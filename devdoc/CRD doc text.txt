Advanced Hikaru usage

Creating Derived Classes of Existing Classes
============================================

Defining New Classes to Serve as a CRD
======================================

Hikaru includes the ability to generate JSON schema from user-defined subclasses of
HikaruBase and HikaruDocument base for the purpose of defining custom resource definitions
(CRDs), and then subsequently allows you to use these user-defined classes to perform
CRUD operations on the CRD just like with already defined K8s resources.

.. note::

    This is a new and evolving feature, and not every capability of JSON Schema will be
    available during earlier releases.

.. note::

    While every attempt has been made to make simple uses of the CRD support features
    easy to access and use, for some of the deeper aspects of Hikaru's CRD support, the
    reader will be expected to understand the abilities and limitations of JSON Schema.
    For any use of these features, the reader will need to understand the ins and outs
    of creating CRDs (Hikaru does include all standard documentation for CRDs in the
    CustomResourceDefinition class).
