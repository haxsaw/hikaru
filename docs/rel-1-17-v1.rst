*********************************************
Autodoc for K8s Rel 1.17 v1 document classes
*********************************************

This page contains the docstrings for the top-level classes
(HikaruDocumentBase subclasses)
in ``hikaru.model.rel_1_17.v1.documents``. Instances of these classes are used
directly with K8s (other objects are embedded within these), and methods are
only defined on these classes.

If you need to access doc for all objects, refer to the docstrings for the full
set of classes in ``hikaru.model.rel_1_17.v1.v1``.

The doc starts with the standard module-level warning not to edit the file.
