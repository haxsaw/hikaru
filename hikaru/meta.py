The meta module contains all the support to reflectively process objects

class from which all Kubernetes model version classes are derived. The base
class provides all of the machinery for working with the both Python and YAML:
it can do the YAML parsing, the Python generation, and the Python runtime

        Returns a list of catalog entries for the named field wherever it occurs
        in the model.

        This method returns a list of CatalogEntry instances that match the criteria
        of the input parameters. At very least, the list will contain all entries
        for an attribute named 'name'.

        The list of returned items can be further reduced by supplying a value for the
        'following' argument, which names one or more attributes that must come before
        the named attribute in order for the entry to be included in the returned list.
        The 'following' argument may be specified as a '.' separated string of
        attribute names or as a list of strings. These describe the prerequisite
        attributes that must be on the path to the named attribute, but not necessarily
        consecutively. By specifying 'following' you can essentially establish a
        context in which you find the named attribute. The attributes named in
        'following' will be considered in order, but they don't have to be directly
        sequential in the model.

        :param name: string containing a name for an attribute somewhere in the model,
            the search for with starts at 'self'. This must be a legal Python identifier,
            not an integer.
        :param following: Sequence of strings or a single string with elements
            separated by '.'. These elements must appear somewhere along the path to
            'name' in order, but not necessarily consecutively. These will serve as a
            way to specify 'signposts' along the way to the desired field. Each element
            is either an attribute name or an integer for lists to identify which
            element in the list must be seen before 'name'. For example, say you had a
            model of a Pod and wanted all the attributes called 'name', but only within
            a container's volumeMounts objects. You can get these with the following
            invocation::

                p.find_by_name('name',
                               following="containers.volumeMounts")

            Or suppose you wanted 'exec' from anywhere in the lifecycle object
            of the first container in a pod::

                p.find_by_name('exec',
                               following=['containers', 0, 'lifecycle'])

            or::

                p.find_by_name('exec',
                               following="containers.0.lifecycle")

            Or suppose you wanted to find all the httpHeaders 'name' from in the
            lifecycle in any container in a pod::

                p.find_by_name('name',
                               following="containers.lifecycle.httpGet")

            In the last example, 'lifecycle' is an direct attribute of a single
            container, but 'httpGet' is several objects beneath the lifecycle.

        process(yaml) on that instance (this method hides the details of making
        an empty instance).

        This method can fill an instance with suitable YAML object, whether a
        full document or a fragment of one, as long as the type of the YAML
        object being processed and the subclass of HikaruBase agree. If a fragment
        of a object that would otherwise be part of a larger object, the fragment
        should not have the same indentation as it would as part of the larger
        document, but instead should be fully "outdented" to the left as if it
        was the standalone document itself.

        Merges the values of another object of the same type into self

        Merge allows you to take the values from another HikaruBase subclass instance
        of the same type as self and merge them into self. The merge can be done one
        of two ways:

        - The default is to pull over any non-None fields from other into self. If
          additional subobjects are in other then new copies of them are put into
          self (if none exists already), otherwise values are merged into the subobject.
        - If ``overwrite`` is True, then every field from other is pulled into
          self. That means that it is possible that a field in self that previously
          had a value may become None after a merge with overwrite. Overwrite also
          implies replacing all contents of dicts and lists in self.

        :param other: source of values to merge into self. Must be the same 'type'
            as self, but the interpretation of 'type' is governed by the
            enforce_version parameter (see below).
        :param overwrite: optional bool, default False. The default only merges in
            attributes from other that are non-None. Hence, None attributes in other
            will never replace actual values in self. If True, then all data is taken
            from other verbatim, which can result in a loss of attribute values in self.
        :param enforce_version: optional bool, default False. The default simply checks
            to see if self and other have the same class *names* rather than the
            same actual class. This allows for merging data from objects from one
            version of Kubernetes to another. If enforce_version is True, then merge()
            will check to see both self and other are from the same class. If either
            of these versions of type checking don't match, then merge will raise
            a TypeError.
        :raises TypeError: if other has an attribute to merge into self that self
            doesn't know about, or if checking that the 'type' of self and other,
            or any of their components, results in them not being merge-able.

        Compares attribute type annotation to actual data; issues warning on mismatches.

        This method compares the type of each attribute based on the type annotation
        against the type of the actual data in the attribute and generates a warning
        object whenever a mismatch is discovered. The search for mismatches starts
        at ``self`` and recursively searches any HikaruBase objects contained in
        ``self``.

        Note that if ``get_type_warnings()`` finds an attribute that is a
        HikaruBase object of the incorrect type, ``get_type_warnings()``
        will NOT inspect the incorrect object's attributes for type correctness.
        The object itself will be flagged as incorrect, but checking will not
        continue inside the incorrect object. Other checks will still proceed.

        :return: a list of TypeWarning namedtuple objects. The fields should be
            interpreted as follows:

            - cls: the class object that contains the attribute that has a type mismatch
            - attrname: the name of the attribute that has the type mismatch
            - path: a list of strings that indicates from ``self`` how to reach the attr
            - warning: a string that contains the text of the warning.

            Note that the first three fields are similar to those from CatalogEntry,
            however their interpretation is slightly different.

            A return of an empty list indicates that there were no TypeWarnings.
            This DOES NOT indicate that there aren't errors in usage; for example, if
            and object may contain one of three alternative objects, this method doesn't
            check if that constraint holds true; it only checks that the types of any
            contained objects are correct.

    # class attributes.
    #
    # it turns out that the swagger file defines the 'list' operations
    # on REST calls that return an object that contains a list of other objects.
    # So for example, the listJobForAllNamespaces operation returns a JobList
    # object which contains Job objects. However, these list operations also
    # form the backbone of thw 'watch' functionality of the underlying K8s
    # client. These watch operations do not return the list object (from above,
    # not JobList), but instead return just the contained objects as they
    # occur (just Jobs). So what we want to have happen is that if users want
    # the list object they call a static method on the relevant class, but if they
    # want to watch the contents of one of those objects using the watch facility
    # we want them to do that via the object contained in the list. So for example,
    # use JobList to get lists of Jobs, but use Job for a Job watcher.
    #
    # so here's how this will get done:
    # 1) invoking operations directly
    # Since in the swagger the list operations return list objects, we'll keep
    # these together and make these static methods on this list classes. So
    # if the user wants to get list objects they will simply invoke the relevant
    # method on the list class.
    #
    # 2) performing watch operations:
    # Watch operations result in individual objects coming from an iterator, and
    # we'd like to reference the actual objects that the watch will yield instead
    # of the list object that contains the method that implements the watch
    # semantics. further, we want to hide from the user what API object and
    # method that needs to be used to make the watch happen. We'll achieve this
    # in the following way: in the list class, we will store one or two references
    # to WatchDescriptor objects that contain the information needed to
    # execute either a namespace-bound watch or a namespace-agnostic watch.
    # The attributes involved here will be _namespaced_watcher and _watcher,
    # respectively. However, since we want watches to be initiated from the
    # perspective of the class that the watch will emit, a third attribute,
    # _watcher_cls, will contain a reference to to the associated list class
    # that contains the previous two attributes. To reuse the example from above,
    # JobList will have references for WatchDescriptor objects for the relevant
    # methods in the _namespaced_watcher and _watcher attributes, and then the
    # Job class will have a reference to the JobList class in the _watcher_cls
    # attribute. A value for 'None' in any of these attributes will mean that
    # the associated operation isn't supported.
    #
    # These references will be used by the code in the 'watch' module to ensure
    # that the proper underlying K8s methods are used.

    # The build system will ensure that all these attributes are assigned properly
    # when the models get built from the swagger files.

        Returns a status object, if a call resulted in on

        It turns out that for certain resources, a delete() operation will result in K8s returning a sort of odd
        object: a Status resource, but one whose kind and apiVersion properties indicate it is a different type
        of message altogether. In these instances, Hikaru would try to instantiate the class identified by the
        kind/apiVersion attributes, but generally not fail as most of the time the pieces that are missing in the
        received message are optional on the receiving class. However, this doesn't always happen, and besides,
        the lack of visible status hides important information. So the following solution was settled on in order
        to not break existing code: Hikaru now detects if a Status object is being returned, and if so it creates
        and instance with the received data and stores it in a private variable. The method returns self as usual,

        :param exclusive_maximum: optional bool; whether the maximum includes or excludes the maximum itself. If True,
            the property's value must be < maximum, and if False it may be <= maximum. It makes no sense to supply
            this without also specifying the maximum.
        :param pattern: optional string; a regular expression in JSON notation that describes the accepted strings
            for the property (which must be type string). Usually best specified with a raw string to avoid regex
            escapes.
        :param multiple_of: optional float or int; specifies that the property value must be evenly divisible by the
            value of this parameter. The type of value should match the type of the property.
        :param min_items: optional int; for array parameters, indicates the minimum number of elements that the
            array must have.
        :param max_items: optional int; for array parameters, indicates the maximum number of elements that the
            array must have.
        :param unique_items: optional bool; for array parameters, True indicates that each array element must have a
            unique value.
