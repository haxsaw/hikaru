class SelfSubjectRulesReview(HikaruDocumentBase):
    r"""
    SelfSubjectRulesReview enumerates the set of actions the current user can perform
    within a namespace. The returned list of actions may be incomplete depending on the
    server's authorization mode, and any errors experienced during the evaluation.
    SelfSubjectRulesReview should be used by UIs to show/hide actions, or to quickly let
    an end user reason about their permissions. It should NOT Be used by external systems
    to drive authorization decisions as this raises confused deputy, cache
    lifetime/revocation, and correctness concerns. SubjectAccessReview, and
    LocalAccessReview are the correct way to defer authorization decisions to the API
    server.

@dataclass
class ObjectMeta(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all
    objects users must create.

    Full name: v1.ObjectMeta

    Attributes:
    clusterName: The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to
        distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This
        field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in
        create or update request.
    creationTimestamp: CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when
        this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order
        across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in
        RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists.
        More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    deletionGracePeriodSeconds: Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully
        terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when
        deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
    deletionTimestamp: DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource
        will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
        requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is
        expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable
        by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long
        as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the
        deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
        future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
        time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The
        Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in
        the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
        (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the
        presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp,
        until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully
        terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.
        Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More
        info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    generateName: GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a
        unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used,
        the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value
        will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same
        validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the
        suffix required to make the value unique on the server. If this field is specified
        and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will
        either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique
        name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry
        (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header). Applied only if
        Name is not specified. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
    generation: A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.
        Populated by the system. Read-only.
    name: Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources,
        although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an
        appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation
        idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
    namespace: Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty
        namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical
        representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the
        value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot
        be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
    resourceVersion: An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object
        that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used
        for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a
        resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed
        unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or
        set of resources. Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as
        opaque by clients and . More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
    selfLink: SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system.
        Read-only. DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release
        and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.
    uid: UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically
        generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to
        change on PUT operations. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
    annotations: Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that
        may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are
        not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
    finalizers: Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
        is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the
        list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can
        only be removed.
    labels: Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize
        (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and
        services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
    managedFields: ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that
        are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users
        typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the
        user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like
        "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when
        modifying the object.
    ownerReferences: List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list
        have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is
        managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller,
        with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing
        controller.

            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

@dataclass
class StatefulSetSpec(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    A StatefulSetSpec is the specification of a StatefulSet.

    Full name: v1beta1.StatefulSetSpec

    Attributes:
    serviceName: serviceName is the name of the service that governs this StatefulSet.
        This service must exist before the StatefulSet, and is responsible for the network
        identity of the set. Pods get DNS/hostnames that follow the pattern:
        pod-specific-string.serviceName.default.svc.cluster.local where
        "pod-specific-string" is managed by the StatefulSet controller.
    template: template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if
        insufficient replicas are detected. Each pod stamped out by the StatefulSet will
        fulfill this Template, but have a unique identity from the rest of the
        StatefulSet.
    podManagementPolicy: podManagementPolicy controls how pods are created during initial
        scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy
        is `OrderedReady`, where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1,
        etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When
        scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy
        is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale
        without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.
    replicas: replicas is the desired number of replicas of the given Template. These are
        replicas in the sense that they are instantiations of the same Template, but
        individual replicas also have a consistent identity. If unspecified, defaults to

    NodeConfigStatus describes the status of the config assigned by

    Full name: v1.NodeConfigStatus

    Attributes:
    active: Active reports the checkpointed config the node is actively using. Active will
        represent either the current version of the Assigned config, or the current
        LastKnownGood config, depending on whether attempting to use the Assigned config
        results in an error.
    assigned: Assigned reports the checkpointed config the node will try to use. When
        Node.Spec.ConfigSource is updated, the node checkpoints the associated config
        payload to local disk, along with a record indicating intended config. The node
        refers to this record to choose its config checkpoint, and reports this record in
        Assigned. Assigned only updates in the status after the record has been
        checkpointed to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted, it tries to make the Assigned
        config the Active config by loading and validating the checkpointed payload
        identified by Assigned.
    error: Error describes any problems reconciling the Spec.ConfigSource to the Active
        config. Errors may occur, for example, attempting to checkpoint Spec.ConfigSource
        to the local Assigned record, attempting to checkpoint the payload associated with
        Spec.ConfigSource, attempting to load or validate the Assigned config, etc. Errors
        may occur at different points while syncing config. Earlier errors (e.g. download
        or checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and may
        resolve across Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g. loading or validating a
        checkpointed config) will result in a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter
        case, it is usually possible to resolve the error by fixing the config assigned in
        Spec.ConfigSource. You can find additional information for debugging by searching
        the error message in the Kubelet log. Error is a human-readable description of the
        error state; machines can check whether or not Error is empty, but should not rely
        on the stability of the Error text across Kubelet versions.
    lastKnownGood: LastKnownGood reports the checkpointed config the node will fall back
        to when it encounters an error attempting to use the Assigned config. The Assigned
        config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node determines that the Assigned
        config is stable and correct. This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak
        period starting when the local record of Assigned config is updated. If the
        Assigned config is Active at the end of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood.
        Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use local defaults), the
        LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because the local default config
        is always assumed good. You should not make assumptions about the node's method of
        determining config stability and correctness, as this may change or become
        configurable in the future.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes

@dataclass
class ValidatingWebhook(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    ValidatingWebhook describes an admission webhook and the resources and operations it
    applies to.

    Full name: v1beta1.ValidatingWebhook

    Attributes:
    clientConfig: ClientConfig defines how to communicate with the hook. Required
    name: The name of the admission webhook. Name should be fully qualified, e.g.,
        imagepolicy.kubernetes.io, where "imagepolicy" is the name of the webhook, and
        kubernetes.io is the name of the organization. Required.
    failurePolicy: FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors from the admission
        endpoint are handled - allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Ignore.
    matchPolicy: matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming
        requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent". - Exact: match a request
        only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be
        modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only
        included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a
        request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook. -
        Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via
        another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via
        apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included
        `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to
        apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the
        webhook. Defaults to "Exact"
    namespaceSelector: NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object
        based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object
        itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the
        object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the webhook. For
        example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with
        "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows:
        "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "runlevel", "operator":
        "NotIn", "values": [ "0", "1" ] } ] } If instead you want to only run the webhook
        on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or
        "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
        "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "environment", "operator": "In", "values": [
        "prod", "staging" ] } ] } See
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels for more
        examples of label selectors. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches
        everything.
    objectSelector: ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the
        object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject
        and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if
        either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of
        create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels
        (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to
        match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users
        may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty
        LabelSelector, which matches everything.
    sideEffects: SideEffects states whether this webhookk has side effects. Acceptable
        values are: Unknown, None, Some, NoneOnDryRun Webhooks with side effects MUST
        implement a reconciliation system, since a request may be rejected by a future
        step in the admission change and the side effects therefore need to be undone.
        Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook
        with sideEffects == Unknown or Some. Defaults to Unknown.
    timeoutSeconds: TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the
        timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based
        on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default
        to 30 seconds.
    admissionReviewVersions: AdmissionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred
        `AdmissionReview` versions the Webhook expects. API server will try to use first
        version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this
        list supported by API server, validation will fail for this object. If a persisted
        webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions
        known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail and be subject to the
        failure policy. Default to `['v1beta1']`.
    rules: Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook
        cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.
        However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and
        MutatingAdmissionWebhooks from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be
        recovered from without completely disabling the plugin,
        ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called on
        admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and
        MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.

    allowVolumeExpansion: AllowVolumeExpansion shows whether the storage class allow
        volume expand
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

        `Namespaced`.
    conversion: conversion defines conversion settings for the CRD.
    preserveUnknownFields: preserveUnknownFields indicates that object fields which are

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid

        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be

            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client

            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond

            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

    maxSkew: MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. It's

        topology domains of a given topology type. For example, in a 3-zone cluster,
        MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: | zone1
        | zone2 | zone3 | | P | P | | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be
        scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the
        ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming
        pod can be scheduled onto any zone. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and
        0 is not allowed.
    topologyKey: TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this
        key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider
        each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each
        bucket. It's a required field.
    whenUnsatisfiable: WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't
        satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not
        to schedule it - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to still schedule it It's
        considered as "Unsatisfiable" if and only if placing incoming pod on any topology
        violates "MaxSkew". For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and
        pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P
        P | P | P | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be
        scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
        zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be
        imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

        selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding
        topology domain.

    service: `service` is a reference to the service for this webhook. Either `service` or

    url: `url` gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form
        (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be specified.
        The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use the `service`

    A single application container that you want to run within a pod.

    Full name: v1.Container

    Attributes:
    name: Name of the container specified as a DNS_LABEL. Each container in a pod must
        have a unique name (DNS_LABEL). Cannot be updated.
    image: Docker image name. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images This field is optional to
        allow higher level config management to default or override container images in
        workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.
    imagePullPolicy: Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to
        Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated.
        More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images
    lifecycle: Actions that the management system should take in response to container

    securityContext: Security options the pod should run with. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/security-context/ More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/
    startupProbe: StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized. If
        specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this
        probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This
        can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's
        lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than
        during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. This is an alpha feature
        enabled by the StartupProbe feature flag. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
    stdin: Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container
        runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result
        in EOF. Default is false.
    stdinOnce: Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has
        been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain
        open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened
        on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then
        remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is
        closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false,
        a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is
        false
    terminationMessagePath: Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's
        termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
        Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure
        message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total
        message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to
        /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
    terminationMessagePolicy: Indicate how the termination message should be populated.
        File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container
        status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the
        last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and
        the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80
        lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
    tty: Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to
        be true. Default is false.
    workingDir: Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
        default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be
        updated.
    args: Arguments to the entrypoint. The docker image's CMD is used if this is not
        provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
        environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string
        will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie:
        $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the
        variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info:

    env: List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated.
    envFrom: List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys
        defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported

        the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by
        an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated.
    ports: List of ports to expose from the container. Exposing a port here gives the
        system additional information about the network connections a container uses, but
        is primarily informational. Not specifying a port here DOES NOT prevent that port
        from being exposed. Any port which is listening on the default "0.0.0.0" address
        inside a container will be accessible from the network. Cannot be updated.
    volumeDevices: volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
        This is a beta feature.
    volumeMounts: Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.

    procMount: procMount denotes the type of proc mount to use for the containers. The
        default is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for readonly
        paths and masked paths. This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:

            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

@dataclass
class ServiceSpec(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service.

    Full name: v1.ServiceSpec

    Attributes:
    clusterIP: clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned randomly
        by the master. If an address is specified manually and is not in use by others, it
        will be allocated to the service; otherwise, creation of the service will fail.
        This field can not be changed through updates. Valid values are "None", empty
        string (""), or a valid IP address. "None" can be specified for headless services
        when proxying is not required. Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and
        LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    externalName: externalName is the external reference that kubedns or equivalent will
        return as a CNAME record for this service. No proxying will be involved. Must be a
        valid RFC-1123 hostname (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires Type to
        be ExternalName.
    externalTrafficPolicy: externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route
        external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. "Local" preserves the
        client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type
        services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster" obscures
        the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have
        good overall load-spreading.
    healthCheckNodePort: healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the
        service. If not specified, HealthCheckNodePort is created by the service api
        backend with the allocated nodePort. Will use user-specified nodePort value if
        specified by the client. Only effects when Type is set to LoadBalancer and
        ExternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local.
    ipFamily: ipFamily specifies whether this Service has a preference for a particular IP
        family (e.g. IPv4 vs. IPv6). If a specific IP family is requested, the clusterIP
        field will be allocated from that family, if it is available in the cluster. If no
        IP family is requested, the cluster's primary IP family will be used. Other IP
        fields (loadBalancerIP, loadBalancerSourceRanges, externalIPs) and controllers
        which allocate external load-balancers should use the same IP family. Endpoints
        for this Service will be of this family. This field is immutable after creation.
        Assigning a ServiceIPFamily not available in the cluster (e.g. IPv6 in IPv4 only
        cluster) is an error condition and will fail during clusterIP assignment.
    loadBalancerIP: Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer will get
        created with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on whether the
        underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when a load
        balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does not
        support the feature.
    publishNotReadyAddresses: publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that
        DNS implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the
        Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is false. The primary use
        case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
        propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their readiness for purpose
        of peer discovery.
    sessionAffinity: Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity.
        Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to
        None. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    sessionAffinityConfig: sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session
        affinity.
    type: type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options
        are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ExternalName" maps to
        the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address
        for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if
        that is not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP
        is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of
        endpoints rather than a stable IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a
        port on every node which routes to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on
        NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)
        which routes to the clusterIP. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types
    externalIPs: externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will
        also accept traffic for this service. These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes. The
        user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP. A
        common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes
        system.
    loadBalancerSourceRanges: If specified and supported by the platform, this will
        restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to
        the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does
        not support the feature." More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-cloud-provider-firewall/
    ports: The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    selector: Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this
        selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an external
        process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies to
        types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More

            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can

        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or

            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:

    Full name: v1beta1.APIServiceSpec

    Attributes:
    groupPriorityMinimum: GroupPriorityMininum is the priority this group should have at
        least. Higher priority means that the group is preferred by clients over lower
        priority ones. Note that other versions of this group might specify even higher
        GroupPriorityMininum values such that the whole group gets a higher priority. The
        primary sort is based on GroupPriorityMinimum, ordered highest number to lowest
        (20 before 10). The secondary sort is based on the alphabetical comparison of the
        name of the object. (v1.bar before v1.foo) We'd recommend something like: *.k8s.io
        (except extensions) at 18000 and PaaSes (OpenShift, Deis) are recommended to be in
        the 2000s
    service: Service is a reference to the service for this API server. It must
        communicate on port 443 If the Service is nil, that means the handling for the API
        groupversion is handled locally on this server. The call will simply delegate to
        the normal handler chain to be fulfilled.
    versionPriority: VersionPriority controls the ordering of this API version inside of
        its group. Must be greater than zero. The primary sort is based on
        VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's inside of a
        group, the number can be small, probably in the 10s. In case of equal version
        priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group.
        If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version
        strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a
        "v", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string
        "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first
        by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha),
        and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of
        versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1,
        foo10.

        server's serving certificate. If unspecified, system trust roots on the apiserver

    insecureSkipTLSVerify: InsecureSkipTLSVerify disables TLS certificate verification
        when communicating with this server. This is strongly discouraged. You should use
        the CABundle instead.

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

        the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old RC can be scaled down
        further, followed by scaling up the new RC, ensuring that the total number of pods

            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid

        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

class MutatingWebhook(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    MutatingWebhook describes an admission webhook and the resources and operations it
    applies to.

    Full name: v1beta1.MutatingWebhook

    Attributes:
    clientConfig: ClientConfig defines how to communicate with the hook. Required
    name: The name of the admission webhook. Name should be fully qualified, e.g.,
        imagepolicy.kubernetes.io, where "imagepolicy" is the name of the webhook, and
        kubernetes.io is the name of the organization. Required.
    failurePolicy: FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors from the admission
        endpoint are handled - allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Ignore.
    matchPolicy: matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming
        requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent". - Exact: match a request
        only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be
        modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only
        included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a
        request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook. -
        Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via
        another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via
        apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included
        `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to
        apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the
        webhook. Defaults to "Exact"
    namespaceSelector: NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object
        based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object
        itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the
        object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the webhook. For
        example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with
        "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows:
        "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "runlevel", "operator":
        "NotIn", "values": [ "0", "1" ] } ] } If instead you want to only run the webhook
        on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or
        "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
        "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "environment", "operator": "In", "values": [
        "prod", "staging" ] } ] } See
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more
        examples of label selectors. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches
        everything.
    objectSelector: ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the
        object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject
        and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if
        either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of
        create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels
        (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to
        match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users
        may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty
        LabelSelector, which matches everything.
    reinvocationPolicy: reinvocationPolicy indicates whether this webhook should be called
        multiple times as part of a single admission evaluation. Allowed values are
        "Never" and "IfNeeded". Never: the webhook will not be called more than once in a
        single admission evaluation. IfNeeded: the webhook will be called at least one
        additional time as part of the admission evaluation if the object being admitted
        is modified by other admission plugins after the initial webhook call. Webhooks
        that specify this option *must* be idempotent, able to process objects they
        previously admitted. Note: * the number of additional invocations is not
        guaranteed to be exactly one. * if additional invocations result in further
        modifications to the object, webhooks are not guaranteed to be invoked again. *
        webhooks that use this option may be reordered to minimize the number of
        additional invocations. * to validate an object after all mutations are guaranteed
        complete, use a validating admission webhook instead. Defaults to "Never".
    sideEffects: SideEffects states whether this webhookk has side effects. Acceptable
        values are: Unknown, None, Some, NoneOnDryRun Webhooks with side effects MUST
        implement a reconciliation system, since a request may be rejected by a future
        step in the admission change and the side effects therefore need to be undone.
        Requests with the dryRun attribute will be auto-rejected if they match a webhook
        with sideEffects == Unknown or Some. Defaults to Unknown.
    timeoutSeconds: TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the
        timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based
        on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default
        to 30 seconds.
    admissionReviewVersions: AdmissionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred
        `AdmissionReview` versions the Webhook expects. API server will try to use first
        version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this
        list supported by API server, validation will fail for this object. If a persisted
        webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions
        known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail and be subject to the
        failure policy. Default to `['v1beta1']`.
    rules: Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook
        cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.
        However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and
        MutatingAdmissionWebhooks from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be
        recovered from without completely disabling the plugin,
        ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called on
        admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and
        MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.

@dataclass
class PodSpec(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    PodSpec is a description of a pod.

    Full name: v1.PodSpec

    Attributes:
    containers: List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be
        added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be
        updated.
    activeDeadlineSeconds: Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node
        relative to StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and
        kill associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.
    affinity: If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints
    automountServiceAccountToken: AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service
        account token should be automatically mounted.
    dnsConfig: Specifies the DNS parameters of a pod. Parameters specified here will be
        merged to the generated DNS configuration based on DNSPolicy.
    dnsPolicy: Set DNS policy for the pod. Defaults to "ClusterFirst". Valid values are
        'ClusterFirstWithHostNet', 'ClusterFirst', 'Default' or 'None'. DNS parameters
        given in DNSConfig will be merged with the policy selected with DNSPolicy. To have
        DNS options set along with hostNetwork, you have to specify DNS policy explicitly
        to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.
    enableServiceLinks: EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services
        should be injected into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker
        links. Optional: Defaults to true.
    hostIPC: Use the host's ipc namespace. Optional: Default to false.
    hostNetwork: Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host's network namespace.
        If this option is set, the ports that will be used must be specified. Default to
        false.
    hostPID: Use the host's pid namespace. Optional: Default to false.
    hostname: Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's hostname will
        be set to a system-defined value.
    nodeName: NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is
        non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming that
        it fits resource requirements.
    preemptionPolicy: PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower
        priority. One of Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if
        unset. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the
        NonPreemptingPriority feature.
    priority: The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the
        priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents
        users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from
        PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.
    priorityClassName: If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical"
        and "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the highest
        priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be
        defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the
        pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.
    restartPolicy: Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always,
        OnFailure, Never. Default to Always. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy
    runtimeClassName: RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io
        group, which should be used to run this pod. If no RuntimeClass resource matches
        the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy"
        RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition
        that uses the default runtime handler. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md This is a beta
        feature as of Kubernetes v1.14.
    schedulerName: If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not
        specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
    securityContext: SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common
        container settings. Optional: Defaults to empty. See type description for default
        values of each field.
    serviceAccount: DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for
        ServiceAccountName. Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.
    serviceAccountName: ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run
        this pod. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/
    shareProcessNamespace: Share a single process namespace between all of the containers
        in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes
        from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container
        will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set.
        Optional: Default to false. This field is beta-level and may be disabled with the
        PodShareProcessNamespace feature.
    subdomain: If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be
        "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not specified,
        the pod will not have a domainname at all.
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds: Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate
        gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative
        integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the
        default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in
        seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and
        the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value
        longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.
    ephemeralContainers: List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral
        containers may be run in an existing pod to perform user-initiated actions such as
        debugging. This list cannot be specified when creating a pod, and it cannot be
        modified by updating the pod spec. In order to add an ephemeral container to an
        existing pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource. This field is
        alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the EphemeralContainers
        feature.
    hostAliases: HostAliases is an optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected
        into the pod's hosts file if specified. This is only valid for non-hostNetwork
        pods.
    imagePullSecrets: ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the
        same namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If
        specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller implementations for
        them to use. For example, in the case of docker, only DockerConfig type secrets
        are honored. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod
    initContainers: List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init
        containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init
        container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to
        its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
        unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions,
        Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of
        an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest
        request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of that value or
        the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers in a
        similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or removed. Cannot be
        updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/
    nodeSelector: NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a
        node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on
        that node. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/
    overhead: Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for
        a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the
        RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is
        enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass
        admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead
        already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead
        will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it
        will remain unset and treated as zero. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/20190226-pod-overhead.md This field
        is alpha-level as of Kubernetes v1.16, and is only honored by servers that enable
        the PodOverhead feature.
    readinessGates: If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness.
        A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in
        the readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/0007-pod-ready%2B%2B.md
    tolerations: If specified, the pod's tolerations.
    topologySpreadConstraints: TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods
        ought to spread across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way
        which abides by the constraints. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by
        clusters that enables the EvenPodsSpread feature. All topologySpreadConstraints
        are ANDed.
    volumes: List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod. More

class PodStatus(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    PodStatus represents information about the status of a pod. Status may trail the
    actual state of a system, especially if the node that hosts the pod cannot contact the
    control plane.

    Full name: v1.PodStatus

    Attributes:
    hostIP: IP address of the host to which the pod is assigned. Empty if not yet
        scheduled.
    message: A human readable message indicating details about why the pod is in this
        condition.
    nominatedNodeName: nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on
        the node, but it cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive
        their graceful termination periods. This field does not guarantee that the pod
        will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod elsewhere if
        other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to give the
        resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption.
        As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is
        scheduled.
    phase: The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its
        lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual
        container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status. There are five
        possible phase values: Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes
        system, but one or more of the container images has not been created. This
        includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over
        the network, which could take a while. Running: The pod has been bound to a node,
        and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still
        running, or is in the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers
        in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All
        containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated
        in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by
        the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained,
        typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-phase
    podIP: IP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within the cluster. Empty if
        not yet allocated.
    qosClass: The Quality of Service (QOS) classification assigned to the pod based on
        resource requirements See PodQOSClass type for available QOS classes More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/design-proposals/node/resource-qos.md
    reason: A brief CamelCase message indicating details about why the pod is in this
        state. e.g. 'Evicted'
    startTime: RFC 3339 date and time at which the object was acknowledged by the Kubelet.
        This is before the Kubelet pulled the container image(s) for the pod.
    conditions: Current service state of pod. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-conditions
    containerStatuses: The list has one entry per container in the manifest. Each entry is
        currently the output of `docker inspect`. More info:

    ephemeralContainerStatuses: Status for any ephemeral containers that have run in this
        pod. This field is alpha-level and is only populated by servers that enable the
        EphemeralContainers feature.
    initContainerStatuses: The list has one entry per init container in the manifest. The

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients

            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify

            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

class EphemeralContainer(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    An EphemeralContainer is a container that may be added temporarily to an existing pod
    for user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource
    or scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a pod
    is removed or restarted. If an ephemeral container causes a pod to exceed its resource
    allocation, the pod may be evicted. Ephemeral containers may not be added by directly
    updating the pod spec. They must be added via the pod's ephemeralcontainers
    subresource, and they will appear in the pod spec once added. This is an alpha feature
    enabled by the EphemeralContainers feature flag.

    Full name: v1.EphemeralContainer

    Attributes:
    name: Name of the ephemeral container specified as a DNS_LABEL. This name must be
        unique among all containers, init containers and ephemeral containers.
    image: Docker image name. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images
    imagePullPolicy: Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to
        Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated.
        More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images
    lifecycle: Lifecycle is not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    livenessProbe: Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    readinessProbe: Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    resources: Resources are not allowed for ephemeral containers. Ephemeral containers
        use spare resources already allocated to the pod.
    securityContext: SecurityContext is not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    startupProbe: Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    stdin: Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container
        runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result
        in EOF. Default is false.
    stdinOnce: Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has
        been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain
        open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened
        on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then
        remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is
        closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false,
        a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is
        false
    targetContainerName: If set, the name of the container from PodSpec that this
        ephemeral container targets. The ephemeral container will be run in the namespaces
        (IPC, PID, etc) of this container. If not set then the ephemeral container is run
        in whatever namespaces are shared for the pod. Note that the container runtime
        must support this feature.
    terminationMessagePath: Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's
        termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
        Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure
        message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total
        message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to
        /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
    terminationMessagePolicy: Indicate how the termination message should be populated.
        File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container
        status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the
        last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and
        the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80
        lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
    tty: Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to
        be true. Default is false.
    workingDir: Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
        default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be
        updated.
    args: Arguments to the entrypoint. The docker image's CMD is used if this is not
        provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's
        environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string
        will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with a double $$, ie:
        $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the
        variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
    command: Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The docker image's ENTRYPOINT
        is used if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded
        using the container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference
        in the input string will be unchanged. The $(VAR_NAME) syntax can be escaped with
        a double $$, ie: $$(VAR_NAME). Escaped references will never be expanded,

        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
    env: List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated.
    envFrom: List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys
        defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported
        as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources,
        the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by
        an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated.
    ports: Ports are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    volumeDevices: volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
        This is a beta feature.
    volumeMounts: Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Cannot be updated.

            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial

            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to

            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during

            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

    PodSecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings.
    Some fields are also present in container.securityContext. Field values of
    container.securityContext take precedence over field values of PodSecurityContext.

    Full name: v1.PodSecurityContext

    Attributes:
    fsGroup: A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod. Some
        volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume to be owned
        by the pod: 1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup 2. The setgid bit is set (new
        files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup) 3. The permission bits are
        OR'd with rw-rw---- If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and
        permissions of any volume.
    runAsGroup: The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime
        default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both
        SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
        takes precedence for that container.
    runAsNonRoot: Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the
        Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0
        (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such
        validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both
        SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
        takes precedence.
    runAsUser: The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user
        specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext. If
        set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
        SecurityContext takes precedence for that container.
    seLinuxOptions: The SELinux context to be applied to all containers. If unspecified,
        the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.
        May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for
        that container.
    windowsOptions: The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If
        unspecified, the options within a container's SecurityContext will be used. If set
        in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
        SecurityContext takes precedence.
    supplementalGroups: A list of groups applied to the first process run in each
        container, in addition to the container's primary GID. If unspecified, no groups
        will be added to any container.
    sysctls: Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with
        unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

class RuntimeClass(HikaruDocumentBase):
    r"""
    RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the cluster. The
    RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime is used to run all
    containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are (currently) manually defined by a user or
    cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is responsible for
    resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the pod. For more details, see
    https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md

    Full name: RuntimeClass

    Attributes:
    handler: Handler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the CRI
        implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible values are
        specific to the node & CRI configuration. It is assumed that all handlers are
        available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every
        node. For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI runtime
        (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The
        Handler must conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and is immutable.
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
        object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value,
        and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be
        updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    metadata: More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    overhead: Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for
        a given RuntimeClass. For more details, see
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/20190226-pod-overhead.md This field
        is alpha-level as of Kubernetes v1.15, and is only honored by servers that enable
        the PodOverhead feature.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient

    r"""
    PodSecurityPolicySpec defines the policy enforced.

    Full name: extensions.v1beta1.PodSecurityPolicySpec

    Attributes:
    fsGroup: fsGroup is the strategy that will dictate what fs group is used by the
        SecurityContext.
    runAsUser: runAsUser is the strategy that will dictate the allowable RunAsUser values
        that may be set.
    seLinux: seLinux is the strategy that will dictate the allowable labels that may be
        set.
    supplementalGroups: supplementalGroups is the strategy that will dictate what
        supplemental groups are used by the SecurityContext.
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: allowPrivilegeEscalation determines if a pod can request to
        allow privilege escalation. If unspecified, defaults to true.
    defaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation: defaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation controls the default
        setting for whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process.
    hostIPC: hostIPC determines if the policy allows the use of HostIPC in the pod spec.
    hostNetwork: hostNetwork determines if the policy allows the use of HostNetwork in the
        pod spec.
    hostPID: hostPID determines if the policy allows the use of HostPID in the pod spec.
    privileged: privileged determines if a pod can request to be run as privileged.
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: readOnlyRootFilesystem when set to true will force containers
        to run with a read only root file system. If the container specifically requests
        to run with a non-read only root file system the PSP should deny the pod. If set
        to false the container may run with a read only root file system if it wishes but
        it will not be forced to.
    runAsGroup: RunAsGroup is the strategy that will dictate the allowable RunAsGroup
        values that may be set. If this field is omitted, the pod's RunAsGroup can take
        any value. This field requires the RunAsGroup feature gate to be enabled.
    runtimeClass: runtimeClass is the strategy that will dictate the allowable
        RuntimeClasses for a pod. If this field is omitted, the pod's runtimeClassName
        field is unrestricted. Enforcement of this field depends on the RuntimeClass
        feature gate being enabled.
    allowedCSIDrivers: AllowedCSIDrivers is a whitelist of inline CSI drivers that must be
        explicitly set to be embedded within a pod spec. An empty value indicates that any
        CSI driver can be used for inline ephemeral volumes. This is an alpha field, and
        is only honored if the API server enables the CSIInlineVolume feature gate.
    allowedCapabilities: allowedCapabilities is a list of capabilities that can be
        requested to add to the container. Capabilities in this field may be added at the
        pod author's discretion. You must not list a capability in both
        allowedCapabilities and requiredDropCapabilities.
    allowedFlexVolumes: allowedFlexVolumes is a whitelist of allowed Flexvolumes. Empty or
        nil indicates that all Flexvolumes may be used. This parameter is effective only
        when the usage of the Flexvolumes is allowed in the "volumes" field.
    allowedHostPaths: allowedHostPaths is a white list of allowed host paths. Empty
        indicates that all host paths may be used.
    allowedProcMountTypes: AllowedProcMountTypes is a whitelist of allowed ProcMountTypes.
        Empty or nil indicates that only the DefaultProcMountType may be used. This
        requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be enabled.
    allowedUnsafeSysctls: allowedUnsafeSysctls is a list of explicitly allowed unsafe
        sysctls, defaults to none. Each entry is either a plain sysctl name or ends in "*"
        in which case it is considered as a prefix of allowed sysctls. Single * means all
        unsafe sysctls are allowed. Kubelet has to whitelist all allowed unsafe sysctls
        explicitly to avoid rejection. Examples: e.g. "foo/*" allows "foo/bar", "foo/baz",
        etc. e.g. "foo.*" allows "foo.bar", "foo.baz", etc.
    defaultAddCapabilities: defaultAddCapabilities is the default set of capabilities that
        will be added to the container unless the pod spec specifically drops the
        capability. You may not list a capability in both defaultAddCapabilities and
        requiredDropCapabilities. Capabilities added here are implicitly allowed, and need
        not be included in the allowedCapabilities list.
    forbiddenSysctls: forbiddenSysctls is a list of explicitly forbidden sysctls, defaults
        to none. Each entry is either a plain sysctl name or ends in "*" in which case it
        is considered as a prefix of forbidden sysctls. Single * means all sysctls are
        forbidden. Examples: e.g. "foo/*" forbids "foo/bar", "foo/baz", etc. e.g. "foo.*"
        forbids "foo.bar", "foo.baz", etc.
    hostPorts: hostPorts determines which host port ranges are allowed to be exposed.
    requiredDropCapabilities: requiredDropCapabilities are the capabilities that will be
        dropped from the container. These are required to be dropped and cannot be added.
    volumes: volumes is a white list of allowed volume plugins. Empty indicates that no
        volumes may be used. To allow all volumes you may use '*'.

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a

    name: This is the name of the CSI driver that this object refers to. This MUST be the
        same name returned by the CSI GetPluginName() call for that driver.
    nodeID: nodeID of the node from the driver point of view. This field enables
        Kubernetes to communicate with storage systems that do not share the same
        nomenclature for nodes. For example, Kubernetes may refer to a given node as
        "node1", but the storage system may refer to the same node as "nodeA". When
        Kubernetes issues a command to the storage system to attach a volume to a specific
        node, it can use this field to refer to the node name using the ID that the
        storage system will understand, e.g. "nodeA" instead of "node1". This field is
        required.
    allocatable: allocatable represents the volume resources of a node that are available
        for scheduling.
    topologyKeys: topologyKeys is the list of keys supported by the driver. When a driver
        is initialized on a cluster, it provides a set of topology keys that it
        understands (e.g. "company.com/zone", "company.com/region"). When a driver is
        initialized on a node, it provides the same topology keys along with values.
        Kubelet will expose these topology keys as labels on its own node object. When
        Kubernetes does topology aware provisioning, it can use this list to determine
        which labels it should retrieve from the node object and pass back to the driver.
        It is possible for different nodes to use different topology keys. This can be
        empty if driver does not support topology.

class CSIDriverSpec(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    CSIDriverSpec is the specification of a CSIDriver.

    Full name: v1beta1.CSIDriverSpec

    Attributes:
    attachRequired: attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach
        operation (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and
        that the Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the attach volume
        interface which checks the volumeattachment status and waits until the volume is
        attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher coordinates with
        CSI volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach
        operation is complete. If the CSIDriverRegistry feature gate is enabled and the
        value is specified to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise the
        attach operation will be called.
    podInfoOnMount: If set to true, podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver
        requires additional pod information (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount
        operations. If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default
        is false. The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If
        true, Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI
        NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and
        validating the information passed in as VolumeContext. The following VolumeConext
        will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow, but the
        prefix will be used. "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name": pod.Name
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace": pod.Namespace "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid":
        string(pod.UID) "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral": "true" iff the volume is an
        ephemeral inline volume defined by a CSIVolumeSource, otherwise "false"
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral" is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only
        required for drivers which support both the "Persistent" and "Ephemeral"
        VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore this
        field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only support one
        mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines which mode that
        is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver.
    volumeLifecycleModes: VolumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this CSI
        volume driver supports. The default if the list is empty is "Persistent", which is
        the usage defined by the CSI specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the
        usual PV/PVC mechanism. The other mode is "Ephemeral". In this mode, volumes are
        defined inline inside the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is
        tied to the lifecycle of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is
        only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume. For more information
        about implementing this mode, see
        https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A driver can
        support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future.

            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:

            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored. If the
            feature gate WatchBookmarks is not enabled in apiserver, this field
            is ignored. This field is beta.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: When specified with a watch call, shows changes that
            occur after that particular version of a resource. Defaults to
            changes from the beginning of history. When specified for list: - if
            unset, then the result is returned from remote storage based on
            quorum-read flag; - if it's 0, then we simply return what we
            currently have in cache, no guarantee; - if set to non zero, then
            the result is at least as fresh as given rv.
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.
