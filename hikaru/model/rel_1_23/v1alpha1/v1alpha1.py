        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:

        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

    RuntimeClassSpec is a specification of a RuntimeClass. It contains parameters that are
    required to describe the RuntimeClass to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
    implementation, as well as any other components that need to understand how the pod
    will be run. The RuntimeClassSpec is immutable.

    Full name: RuntimeClassSpec

    Attributes:
    runtimeHandler: RuntimeHandler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that
        the CRI implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible values
        are specific to the node & CRI configuration. It is assumed that all handlers are
        available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every
        node. For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI runtime
        (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The
        RuntimeHandler must be lowercase, conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123)
        requirements, and is immutable.
    overhead: Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for
        a given RuntimeClass. For more details, see
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/688-pod-overhead/README.md This
        field is beta-level as of Kubernetes v1.18, and is only honored by servers that
        enable the PodOverhead feature.
    scheduling: Scheduling holds the scheduling constraints to ensure that pods running
        with this RuntimeClass are scheduled to nodes that support it. If scheduling is
        nil, this RuntimeClass is assumed to be supported by all nodes.

class CSIStorageCapacity(HikaruDocumentBase):
    r"""
    CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given
    StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular topology segment.
    This can be used when considering where to instantiate new PersistentVolumes. For
    example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has "1234 GiB"
    available in "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1" - StorageClass "localssd" has "10
    GiB" available in "kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123" The following three cases all
    imply that no capacity is available for a certain combination: - no object exists with
    suitable topology and storage class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is
    unset - such an object exists, but the capacity is zero The producer of these objects
    can decide which approach is more suitable. They are consumed by the kube-scheduler if
    the CSIStorageCapacity beta feature gate is enabled there and a CSI driver opts into
    capacity-aware scheduling with CSIDriver.StorageCapacity.

    Full name: CSIStorageCapacity

    Attributes:
    storageClassName: The name of the StorageClass that the reported capacity applies to.
        It must meet the same requirements as the name of a StorageClass object
        (non-empty, DNS subdomain). If that object no longer exists, the
        CSIStorageCapacity object is obsolete and should be removed by its creator. This
        field is immutable.
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
        object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value,
        and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    capacity: Capacity is the value reported by the CSI driver in its GetCapacityResponse
        for a GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that match the previous
        fields. The semantic is currently (CSI spec 1.2) defined as: The available
        capacity, in bytes, of the storage that can be used to provision volumes. If not
        set, that information is currently unavailable and treated like zero capacity.
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be
        updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    maximumVolumeSize: MaximumVolumeSize is the value reported by the CSI driver in its
        GetCapacityResponse for a GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that
        match the previous fields. This is defined since CSI spec 1.4.0 as the largest
        size that may be used in a CreateVolumeRequest.capacity_range.required_bytes field
        to create a volume with the same parameters as those in GetCapacityRequest. The
        corresponding value in the Kubernetes API is ResourceRequirements.Requests in a
        volume claim.
    metadata: Standard object's metadata. The name has no particular meaning. It must be
        be a DNS subdomain (dots allowed, 253 characters). To ensure that there are no
        conflicts with other CSI drivers on the cluster, the recommendation is to use
        csisc-<uuid>, a generated name, or a reverse-domain name which ends with the
        unique CSI driver name. Objects are namespaced. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    nodeTopology: NodeTopology defines which nodes have access to the storage for which
        capacity was reported. If not set, the storage is not accessible from any node in
        the cluster. If empty, the storage is accessible from all nodes. This field is
        immutable.

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.
