        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See

            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be

        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions

        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a

    Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster. It generally denotes some
    state change in the system. Events have a limited retention time and triggers and
    messages may evolve with time. Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an
    event with a given Reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued
    existence of events with that Reason. Events should be treated as informative,
    best-effort, supplemental data.

    Full name: Event

    Attributes:
    eventTime: eventTime is the time when this Event was first observed. It is required.
    action: action is what action was taken/failed regarding to the regarding object. It
        is machine-readable. This field can have at most 128 characters.
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
        object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value,
        and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    deprecatedCount: deprecatedCount is the deprecated field assuring backward
        compatibility with core.v1 Event type.
    deprecatedFirstTimestamp: deprecatedFirstTimestamp is the deprecated field assuring
        backward compatibility with core.v1 Event type.
    deprecatedLastTimestamp: deprecatedLastTimestamp is the deprecated field assuring
        backward compatibility with core.v1 Event type.
    deprecatedSource: deprecatedSource is the deprecated field assuring backward
        compatibility with core.v1 Event type.
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be
        updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    metadata: Standard object's metadata. More info:

    note: note is a human-readable description of the status of this operation. Maximal
        length of the note is 1kB, but libraries should be prepared to handle values up to
        64kB.
    reason: reason is why the action was taken. It is human-readable. This field can have
        at most 128 characters.
    regarding: regarding contains the object this Event is about. In most cases it's an
        Object reporting controller implements, e.g. ReplicaSetController implements
        ReplicaSets and this event is emitted because it acts on some changes in a
        ReplicaSet object.
    related: related is the optional secondary object for more complex actions. E.g. when
        regarding object triggers a creation or deletion of related object.
    reportingController: reportingController is the name of the controller that emitted
        this Event, e.g. `kubernetes.io/kubelet`. This field cannot be empty for new
        Events.
    reportingInstance: reportingInstance is the ID of the controller instance, e.g.
        `kubelet-xyzf`. This field cannot be empty for new Events and it can have at most
        128 characters.
    series: series is data about the Event series this event represents or nil if it's a
        singleton Event.
    type: type is the type of this event (Normal, Warning), new types could be added in
        the future. It is machine-readable.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions

        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.

            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more

            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the

        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify

    RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the cluster. The
    RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime is used to run all
    containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are (currently) manually defined by a user or
    cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is responsible for
    resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the pod. For more details, see
    https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class

    Full name: RuntimeClass

    Attributes:
    handler: Handler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the CRI
        implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible values are
        specific to the node & CRI configuration. It is assumed that all handlers are
        available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every
        node. For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI runtime
        (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The
        Handler must be lowercase, conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and
        is immutable.
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
        object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value,
        and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be
        updated. In CamelCase. More info:

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.

    PodSecurityPolicySpec defines the policy enforced.

    Full name: PodSecurityPolicySpec

    Attributes:
    fsGroup: fsGroup is the strategy that will dictate what fs group is used by the
        SecurityContext.
    runAsUser: runAsUser is the strategy that will dictate the allowable RunAsUser values
        that may be set.
    seLinux: seLinux is the strategy that will dictate the allowable labels that may be
        set.
    supplementalGroups: supplementalGroups is the strategy that will dictate what
        supplemental groups are used by the SecurityContext.
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: allowPrivilegeEscalation determines if a pod can request to
        allow privilege escalation. If unspecified, defaults to true.
    defaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation: defaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation controls the default
        setting for whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process.
    hostIPC: hostIPC determines if the policy allows the use of HostIPC in the pod spec.
    hostNetwork: hostNetwork determines if the policy allows the use of HostNetwork in the
        pod spec.
    hostPID: hostPID determines if the policy allows the use of HostPID in the pod spec.
    privileged: privileged determines if a pod can request to be run as privileged.
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: readOnlyRootFilesystem when set to true will force containers
        to run with a read only root file system. If the container specifically requests
        to run with a non-read only root file system the PSP should deny the pod. If set
        to false the container may run with a read only root file system if it wishes but
        it will not be forced to.
    runAsGroup: RunAsGroup is the strategy that will dictate the allowable RunAsGroup
        values that may be set. If this field is omitted, the pod's RunAsGroup can take
        any value. This field requires the RunAsGroup feature gate to be enabled.
    runtimeClass: runtimeClass is the strategy that will dictate the allowable
        RuntimeClasses for a pod. If this field is omitted, the pod's runtimeClassName
        field is unrestricted. Enforcement of this field depends on the RuntimeClass
        feature gate being enabled.
    allowedCSIDrivers: AllowedCSIDrivers is an allowlist of inline CSI drivers that must
        be explicitly set to be embedded within a pod spec. An empty value indicates that
        any CSI driver can be used for inline ephemeral volumes. This is a beta field, and
        is only honored if the API server enables the CSIInlineVolume feature gate.
    allowedCapabilities: allowedCapabilities is a list of capabilities that can be
        requested to add to the container. Capabilities in this field may be added at the
        pod author's discretion. You must not list a capability in both
        allowedCapabilities and requiredDropCapabilities.
    allowedFlexVolumes: allowedFlexVolumes is an allowlist of Flexvolumes. Empty or nil
        indicates that all Flexvolumes may be used. This parameter is effective only when
        the usage of the Flexvolumes is allowed in the "volumes" field.
    allowedHostPaths: allowedHostPaths is an allowlist of host paths. Empty indicates that
        all host paths may be used.
    allowedProcMountTypes: AllowedProcMountTypes is an allowlist of allowed
        ProcMountTypes. Empty or nil indicates that only the DefaultProcMountType may be
        used. This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be enabled.
    allowedUnsafeSysctls: allowedUnsafeSysctls is a list of explicitly allowed unsafe
        sysctls, defaults to none. Each entry is either a plain sysctl name or ends in "*"
        in which case it is considered as a prefix of allowed sysctls. Single * means all
        unsafe sysctls are allowed. Kubelet has to allowlist all allowed unsafe sysctls
        explicitly to avoid rejection. Examples: e.g. "foo/*" allows "foo/bar", "foo/baz",
        etc. e.g. "foo.*" allows "foo.bar", "foo.baz", etc.
    defaultAddCapabilities: defaultAddCapabilities is the default set of capabilities that
        will be added to the container unless the pod spec specifically drops the
        capability. You may not list a capability in both defaultAddCapabilities and
        requiredDropCapabilities. Capabilities added here are implicitly allowed, and need
        not be included in the allowedCapabilities list.
    forbiddenSysctls: forbiddenSysctls is a list of explicitly forbidden sysctls, defaults
        to none. Each entry is either a plain sysctl name or ends in "*" in which case it
        is considered as a prefix of forbidden sysctls. Single * means all sysctls are
        forbidden. Examples: e.g. "foo/*" forbids "foo/bar", "foo/baz", etc. e.g. "foo.*"
        forbids "foo.bar", "foo.baz", etc.
    hostPorts: hostPorts determines which host port ranges are allowed to be exposed.
    requiredDropCapabilities: requiredDropCapabilities are the capabilities that will be
        dropped from the container. These are required to be dropped and cannot be added.
    volumes: volumes is an allowlist of volume plugins. Empty indicates that no volumes
        may be used. To allow all volumes you may use '*'.

class CSIStorageCapacity(HikaruDocumentBase):
    r"""
    CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given
    StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular topology segment.
    This can be used when considering where to instantiate new PersistentVolumes. For
    example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has "1234 GiB"
    available in "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1" - StorageClass "localssd" has "10
    GiB" available in "kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123" The following three cases all
    imply that no capacity is available for a certain combination: - no object exists with
    suitable topology and storage class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is
    unset - such an object exists, but the capacity is zero The producer of these objects
    can decide which approach is more suitable. They are consumed by the kube-scheduler if
    the CSIStorageCapacity beta feature gate is enabled there and a CSI driver opts into
    capacity-aware scheduling with CSIDriver.StorageCapacity.

    Full name: CSIStorageCapacity

    Attributes:
    storageClassName: The name of the StorageClass that the reported capacity applies to.
        It must meet the same requirements as the name of a StorageClass object
        (non-empty, DNS subdomain). If that object no longer exists, the
        CSIStorageCapacity object is obsolete and should be removed by its creator. This
        field is immutable.
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
        object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value,
        and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    capacity: Capacity is the value reported by the CSI driver in its GetCapacityResponse
        for a GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that match the previous
        fields. The semantic is currently (CSI spec 1.2) defined as: The available
        capacity, in bytes, of the storage that can be used to provision volumes. If not
        set, that information is currently unavailable and treated like zero capacity.
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be
        updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    maximumVolumeSize: MaximumVolumeSize is the value reported by the CSI driver in its
        GetCapacityResponse for a GetCapacityRequest with topology and parameters that
        match the previous fields. This is defined since CSI spec 1.4.0 as the largest
        size that may be used in a CreateVolumeRequest.capacity_range.required_bytes field
        to create a volume with the same parameters as those in GetCapacityRequest. The
        corresponding value in the Kubernetes API is ResourceRequirements.Requests in a
        volume claim.
    metadata: Standard object's metadata. The name has no particular meaning. It must be
        be a DNS subdomain (dots allowed, 253 characters). To ensure that there are no
        conflicts with other CSI drivers on the cluster, the recommendation is to use
        csisc-<uuid>, a generated name, or a reverse-domain name which ends with the
        unique CSI driver name. Objects are namespaced. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    nodeTopology: NodeTopology defines which nodes have access to the storage for which

            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions

            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended

            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.
