@dataclass
class MutatingWebhook(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    MutatingWebhook describes an admission webhook and the resources and operations it
    applies to.

    Full name: MutatingWebhook

    Attributes:
    admissionReviewVersions: AdmissionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred
        `AdmissionReview` versions the Webhook expects. API server will try to use first
        version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this
        list supported by API server, validation will fail for this object. If a persisted
        webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions
        known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail and be subject to the
        failure policy.
    clientConfig: ClientConfig defines how to communicate with the hook. Required
    name: The name of the admission webhook. Name should be fully qualified, e.g.,
        imagepolicy.kubernetes.io, where "imagepolicy" is the name of the webhook, and
        kubernetes.io is the name of the organization. Required.
    sideEffects: SideEffects states whether this webhook has side effects. Acceptable
        values are: None, NoneOnDryRun (webhooks created via v1beta1 may also specify Some
        or Unknown). Webhooks with side effects MUST implement a reconciliation system,
        since a request may be rejected by a future step in the admission chain and the
        side effects therefore need to be undone. Requests with the dryRun attribute will
        be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with sideEffects == Unknown or Some.
    failurePolicy: FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors from the admission
        endpoint are handled - allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Fail.
    matchPolicy: matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming
        requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent". - Exact: match a request
        only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be
        modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only
        included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a
        request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook. -
        Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via
        another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via
        apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included
        `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to
        apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the
        webhook. Defaults to "Equivalent"
    namespaceSelector: NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object
        based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object
        itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the
        object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the webhook. For
        example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with
        "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows:
        "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "runlevel", "operator":
        "NotIn", "values": [ "0", "1" ] } ] } If instead you want to only run the webhook
        on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or
        "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
        "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "environment", "operator": "In", "values": [
        "prod", "staging" ] } ] } See
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/ for more
        examples of label selectors. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches
        everything.
    objectSelector: ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the
        object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject
        and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if
        either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of
        create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels
        (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to
        match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users
        may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty
        LabelSelector, which matches everything.
    reinvocationPolicy: reinvocationPolicy indicates whether this webhook should be called
        multiple times as part of a single admission evaluation. Allowed values are
        "Never" and "IfNeeded". Never: the webhook will not be called more than once in a
        single admission evaluation. IfNeeded: the webhook will be called at least one
        additional time as part of the admission evaluation if the object being admitted
        is modified by other admission plugins after the initial webhook call. Webhooks
        that specify this option *must* be idempotent, able to process objects they
        previously admitted. Note: * the number of additional invocations is not
        guaranteed to be exactly one. * if additional invocations result in further
        modifications to the object, webhooks are not guaranteed to be invoked again. *
        webhooks that use this option may be reordered to minimize the number of
        additional invocations. * to validate an object after all mutations are guaranteed
        complete, use a validating admission webhook instead. Defaults to "Never".
    timeoutSeconds: TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the
        timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based
        on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default
        to 10 seconds.
    rules: Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook
        cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.
        However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and
        MutatingAdmissionWebhooks from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be
        recovered from without completely disabling the plugin,
        ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called on
        admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and
        MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See

            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

    ValidatingWebhook describes an admission webhook and the resources and operations it
    applies to.

    Full name: ValidatingWebhook

    Attributes:
    admissionReviewVersions: AdmissionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred
        `AdmissionReview` versions the Webhook expects. API server will try to use first
        version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this
        list supported by API server, validation will fail for this object. If a persisted
        webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions
        known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail and be subject to the
        failure policy.
    clientConfig: ClientConfig defines how to communicate with the hook. Required
    name: The name of the admission webhook. Name should be fully qualified, e.g.,
        imagepolicy.kubernetes.io, where "imagepolicy" is the name of the webhook, and
        kubernetes.io is the name of the organization. Required.
    sideEffects: SideEffects states whether this webhook has side effects. Acceptable
        values are: None, NoneOnDryRun (webhooks created via v1beta1 may also specify Some
        or Unknown). Webhooks with side effects MUST implement a reconciliation system,
        since a request may be rejected by a future step in the admission chain and the
        side effects therefore need to be undone. Requests with the dryRun attribute will
        be auto-rejected if they match a webhook with sideEffects == Unknown or Some.
    failurePolicy: FailurePolicy defines how unrecognized errors from the admission
        endpoint are handled - allowed values are Ignore or Fail. Defaults to Fail.
    matchPolicy: matchPolicy defines how the "rules" list is used to match incoming
        requests. Allowed values are "Exact" or "Equivalent". - Exact: match a request
        only if it exactly matches a specified rule. For example, if deployments can be
        modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but "rules" only
        included `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a
        request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the webhook. -
        Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via
        another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via
        apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and "rules" only included
        `apiGroups:["apps"], apiVersions:["v1"], resources: ["deployments"]`, a request to
        apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the
        webhook. Defaults to "Equivalent"
    namespaceSelector: NamespaceSelector decides whether to run the webhook on an object
        based on whether the namespace for that object matches the selector. If the object
        itself is a namespace, the matching is performed on object.metadata.labels. If the
        object is another cluster scoped resource, it never skips the webhook. For
        example, to run the webhook on any objects whose namespace is not associated with
        "runlevel" of "0" or "1"; you will set the selector as follows:
        "namespaceSelector": { "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "runlevel", "operator":
        "NotIn", "values": [ "0", "1" ] } ] } If instead you want to only run the webhook
        on any objects whose namespace is associated with the "environment" of "prod" or
        "staging"; you will set the selector as follows: "namespaceSelector": {
        "matchExpressions": [ { "key": "environment", "operator": "In", "values": [
        "prod", "staging" ] } ] } See
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels for more
        examples of label selectors. Default to the empty LabelSelector, which matches
        everything.
    objectSelector: ObjectSelector decides whether to run the webhook based on if the
        object has matching labels. objectSelector is evaluated against both the oldObject
        and newObject that would be sent to the webhook, and is considered to match if
        either object matches the selector. A null object (oldObject in the case of
        create, or newObject in the case of delete) or an object that cannot have labels
        (like a DeploymentRollback or a PodProxyOptions object) is not considered to
        match. Use the object selector only if the webhook is opt-in, because end users
        may skip the admission webhook by setting the labels. Default to the empty
        LabelSelector, which matches everything.
    timeoutSeconds: TimeoutSeconds specifies the timeout for this webhook. After the
        timeout passes, the webhook call will be ignored or the API call will fail based
        on the failure policy. The timeout value must be between 1 and 30 seconds. Default
        to 10 seconds.
    rules: Rules describes what operations on what resources/subresources the webhook
        cares about. The webhook cares about an operation if it matches _any_ Rule.
        However, in order to prevent ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and
        MutatingAdmissionWebhooks from putting the cluster in a state which cannot be
        recovered from without completely disabling the plugin,
        ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks and MutatingAdmissionWebhooks are never called on
        admission requests for ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and
        MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See

            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients

            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to

            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the

            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.

            the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The
            request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value

        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.

            is disabled. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard
            warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from
            the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The
            request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will
            only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default
            when the `ServerSideFieldValidation` feature gate is enabled. -
            Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any
            unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate
            fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain
            all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to

            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during

    Spec to control the desired behavior of daemon set rolling update.

    Full name: RollingUpdateDaemonSet

    Attributes:
    maxSurge: The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod that
        can have an updated DaemonSet pod during during an update. Value can be an
        absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). This can not be
        0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by
        rounding up to a minimum of 1. Default value is 0. Example: when this is set to
        30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be running the daemon
        pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their a new pod created before
        the old pod is marked as deleted. The update starts by launching new pods on 30%
        of nodes. Once an updated pod is available (Ready for at least minReadySeconds)
        the old DaemonSet pod on that node is marked deleted. If the old pod becomes
        unavailable for any reason (Ready transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained)
        an updated pod is immediatedly created on that node without considering surge
        limits. Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by the
        daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check fails, and so
        resource intensive daemonsets should take into account that they may cause
        evictions during disruption. This is beta field and enabled/disabled by
        DaemonSetUpdateSurge feature gate.
    maxUnavailable: The maximum number of DaemonSet pods that can be unavailable during
        the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total
        number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute number is
        calculated from percentage by rounding up. This cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0
        Default value is 1. Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total
        number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (i.e.
        status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their pods stopped for an update at any
        given time. The update starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and
        then brings up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available,
        it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least 70% of
        original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during the update.

        new ReplicaSet can be scaled up immediately when the rolling update starts, such
        that the total number of old and new pods do not exceed 130% of desired pods. Once

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by

        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes

class StatefulSetSpec(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    A StatefulSetSpec is the specification of a StatefulSet.

    Full name: StatefulSetSpec

    Attributes:
    selector: selector is a label query over pods that should match the replica count. It
        must match the pod template's labels. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors
    serviceName: serviceName is the name of the service that governs this StatefulSet.
        This service must exist before the StatefulSet, and is responsible for the network
        identity of the set. Pods get DNS/hostnames that follow the pattern:
        pod-specific-string.serviceName.default.svc.cluster.local where
        "pod-specific-string" is managed by the StatefulSet controller.
    template: template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if
        insufficient replicas are detected. Each pod stamped out by the StatefulSet will
        fulfill this Template, but have a unique identity from the rest of the
        StatefulSet.
    minReadySeconds: Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be
        ready without any of its container crashing for it to be considered available.
        Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready) This is an
        alpha field and requires enabling StatefulSetMinReadySeconds feature gate.
    persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy: persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy describes
        the lifecycle of persistent volume claims created from volumeClaimTemplates. By
        default, all persistent volume claims are created as needed and retained until
        manually deleted. This policy allows the lifecycle to be altered, for example by
        deleting persistent volume claims when their stateful set is deleted, or when
        their pod is scaled down. This requires the StatefulSetAutoDeletePVC feature gate
        to be enabled, which is alpha. +optional
    podManagementPolicy: podManagementPolicy controls how pods are created during initial
        scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy
        is `OrderedReady`, where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1,
        etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When
        scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy
        is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale
        without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.
    replicas: replicas is the desired number of replicas of the given Template. These are
        replicas in the sense that they are instantiations of the same Template, but
        individual replicas also have a consistent identity. If unspecified, defaults to
        1.
    revisionHistoryLimit: revisionHistoryLimit is the maximum number of revisions that
        will be maintained in the StatefulSet's revision history. The revision history
        consists of all revisions not represented by a currently applied StatefulSetSpec
        version. The default value is 10.
    updateStrategy: updateStrategy indicates the StatefulSetUpdateStrategy that will be
        employed to update Pods in the StatefulSet when a revision is made to Template.
    volumeClaimTemplates: volumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that pods are allowed
        to reference. The StatefulSet controller is responsible for mapping network
        identities to claims in a way that maintains the identity of a pod. Every claim in
        this list must have at least one matching (by name) volumeMount in one container
        in the template. A claim in this list takes precedence over any volumes in the
        template, with the same name.

            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.

@dataclass
class JobSpec(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    JobSpec describes how the job execution will look like.

    Full name: JobSpec

    Attributes:
    template: Describes the pod that will be created when executing a job. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
    activeDeadlineSeconds: Specifies the duration in seconds relative to the startTime
        that the job may be continuously active before the system tries to terminate it;
        value must be positive integer. If a Job is suspended (at creation or through an
        update), this timer will effectively be stopped and reset when the Job is resumed
        again.
    backoffLimit: Specifies the number of retries before marking this job failed. Defaults
        to 6
    completionMode: CompletionMode specifies how Pod completions are tracked. It can be
        `NonIndexed` (default) or `Indexed`. `NonIndexed` means that the Job is considered
        complete when there have been .spec.completions successfully completed Pods. Each
        Pod completion is homologous to each other. `Indexed` means that the Pods of a Job
        get an associated completion index from 0 to (.spec.completions - 1), available in
        the annotation batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index. The Job is considered
        complete when there is one successfully completed Pod for each index. When value
        is `Indexed`, .spec.completions must be specified and `.spec.parallelism` must be
        less than or equal to 10^5. In addition, The Pod name takes the form
        `$(job-name)-$(index)-$(random-string)`, the Pod hostname takes the form
        `$(job-name)-$(index)`. More completion modes can be added in the future. If the
        Job controller observes a mode that it doesn't recognize, which is possible during
        upgrades due to version skew, the controller skips updates for the Job.
    completions: Specifies the desired number of successfully finished pods the job should
        be run with. Setting to nil means that the success of any pod signals the success
        of all pods, and allows parallelism to have any positive value. Setting to 1 means
        that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that pod signals the success
        of the job. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
    manualSelector: manualSelector controls generation of pod labels and pod selectors.
        Leave `manualSelector` unset unless you are certain what you are doing. When false
        or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job and appends those labels to
        the pod template. When true, the user is responsible for picking unique labels and
        specifying the selector. Failure to pick a unique label may cause this and other
        jobs to not function correctly. However, You may see `manualSelector=true` in jobs
        that were created with the old `extensions/v1beta1` API. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#specifying-your-own-pod-selector
    parallelism: Specifies the maximum desired number of pods the job should run at any
        given time. The actual number of pods running in steady state will be less than
        this number when ((.spec.completions - .status.successful) < .spec.parallelism),
        i.e. when the work left to do is less than max parallelism. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
    selector: A label query over pods that should match the pod count. Normally, the
        system sets this field for you. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors
    suspend: Suspend specifies whether the Job controller should create Pods or not. If a
        Job is created with suspend set to true, no Pods are created by the Job
        controller. If a Job is suspended after creation (i.e. the flag goes from false to
        true), the Job controller will delete all active Pods associated with this Job.
        Users must design their workload to gracefully handle this. Suspending a Job will
        reset the StartTime field of the Job, effectively resetting the
        ActiveDeadlineSeconds timer too. Defaults to false.
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has
        finished execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set,
        ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be automatically
        deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees (e.g. finalizers)
        will be honored. If this field is unset, the Job won't be automatically deleted.

class JobStatus(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    JobStatus represents the current state of a Job.

    Full name: JobStatus

    Attributes:
    active: The number of pending and running pods.
    completedIndexes: CompletedIndexes holds the completed indexes when
        .spec.completionMode = "Indexed" in a text format. The indexes are represented as
        decimal integers separated by commas. The numbers are listed in increasing order.
        Three or more consecutive numbers are compressed and represented by the first and
        last element of the series, separated by a hyphen. For example, if the completed
        indexes are 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7, they are represented as "1,3-5,7".
    completionTime: Represents time when the job was completed. It is not guaranteed to be
        set in happens-before order across separate operations. It is represented in
        RFC3339 form and is in UTC. The completion time is only set when the job finishes
        successfully.
    failed: The number of pods which reached phase Failed.
    ready: The number of pods which have a Ready condition. This field is beta-level. The
        job controller populates the field when the feature gate JobReadyPods is enabled
        (enabled by default).
    startTime: Represents time when the job controller started processing a job. When a
        Job is created in the suspended state, this field is not set until the first time
        it is resumed. This field is reset every time a Job is resumed from suspension. It
        is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.
    succeeded: The number of pods which reached phase Succeeded.
    uncountedTerminatedPods: UncountedTerminatedPods holds the UIDs of Pods that have
        terminated but the job controller hasn't yet accounted for in the status counters.
        The job controller creates pods with a finalizer. When a pod terminates (succeeded
        or failed), the controller does three steps to account for it in the job status:
        (1) Add the pod UID to the arrays in this field. (2) Remove the pod finalizer. (3)
        Remove the pod UID from the arrays while increasing the corresponding counter.
        This field is beta-level. The job controller only makes use of this field when the
        feature gate JobTrackingWithFinalizers is enabled (enabled by default). Old jobs
        might not be tracked using this field, in which case the field remains null.
    conditions: The latest available observations of an object's current state. When a Job
        fails, one of the conditions will have type "Failed" and status true. When a Job
        is suspended, one of the conditions will have type "Suspended" and status true;
        when the Job is resumed, the status of this condition will become false. When a
        Job is completed, one of the conditions will have type "Complete" and status true.

    kube-apiserver (with the "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet" signerName). 2.
    serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with
    the "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" signerName). This API can be used to request
    client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the
    "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client" signerName), or to obtain certificates from
    custom non-Kubernetes signers.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify

    CertificateSigningRequestSpec contains the certificate request.

    Full name: CertificateSigningRequestSpec

    Attributes:
    request: request contains an x509 certificate signing request encoded in a
        "CERTIFICATE REQUEST" PEM block. When serialized as JSON or YAML, the data is
        additionally base64-encoded.
    signerName: signerName indicates the requested signer, and is a qualified name.
        List/watch requests for CertificateSigningRequests can filter on this field using
        a "spec.signerName=NAME" fieldSelector. Well-known Kubernetes signers are: 1.
        "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client": issues client certificates that can be used
        to authenticate to kube-apiserver. Requests for this signer are never
        auto-approved by kube-controller-manager, can be issued by the "csrsigning"
        controller in kube-controller-manager. 2.
        "kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet": issues client certificates that
        kubelets use to authenticate to kube-apiserver. Requests for this signer can be
        auto-approved by the "csrapproving" controller in kube-controller-manager, and can
        be issued by the "csrsigning" controller in kube-controller-manager. 3.
        "kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving" issues serving certificates that kubelets use to
        serve TLS endpoints, which kube-apiserver can connect to securely. Requests for
        this signer are never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager, and can be issued
        by the "csrsigning" controller in kube-controller-manager. More details are
        available at
        https://k8s.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#kubernetes-signers
        Custom signerNames can also be specified. The signer defines: 1. Trust
        distribution: how trust (CA bundles) are distributed. 2. Permitted subjects: and
        behavior when a disallowed subject is requested. 3. Required, permitted, or
        forbidden x509 extensions in the request (including whether subjectAltNames are
        allowed, which types, restrictions on allowed values) and behavior when a
        disallowed extension is requested. 4. Required, permitted, or forbidden key usages
        / extended key usages. 5. Expiration/certificate lifetime: whether it is fixed by
        the signer, configurable by the admin. 6. Whether or not requests for CA
        certificates are allowed.
    expirationSeconds: expirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the
        issued certificate. The certificate signer may issue a certificate with a
        different validity duration so a client must check the delta between the notBefore
        and and notAfter fields in the issued certificate to determine the actual
        duration. The v1.22+ in-tree implementations of the well-known Kubernetes signers
        will honor this field as long as the requested duration is not greater than the
        maximum duration they will honor per the --cluster-signing-duration CLI flag to
        the Kubernetes controller manager. Certificate signers may not honor this field
        for various reasons: 1. Old signer that is unaware of the field (such as the
        in-tree implementations prior to v1.22) 2. Signer whose configured maximum is
        shorter than the requested duration 3. Signer whose configured minimum is longer
        than the requested duration The minimum valid value for expirationSeconds is 600,
        i.e. 10 minutes.
    uid: uid contains the uid of the user that created the CertificateSigningRequest.
        Populated by the API server on creation and immutable.
    username: username contains the name of the user that created the
        CertificateSigningRequest. Populated by the API server on creation and immutable.
    extra: extra contains extra attributes of the user that created the
        CertificateSigningRequest. Populated by the API server on creation and immutable.
    groups: groups contains group membership of the user that created the
        CertificateSigningRequest. Populated by the API server on creation and immutable.
    usages: usages specifies a set of key usages requested in the issued certificate.
        Requests for TLS client certificates typically request: "digital signature", "key
        encipherment", "client auth". Requests for TLS serving certificates typically
        request: "key encipherment", "digital signature", "server auth". Valid values are:

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See

        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the

            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

        allow higher level config management to default or override container images in
        workload controllers like Deployments and StatefulSets.
    imagePullPolicy: Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to
        Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated.
        More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images
    lifecycle: Actions that the management system should take in response to container
        lifecycle events. Cannot be updated.

        specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully. If this
        probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This
        can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's

        during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes
    stdin: Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container
        runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result
        in EOF. Default is false.
    stdinOnce: Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has
        been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain
        open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened
        on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then
        remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is
        closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false,
        a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is
        false
    terminationMessagePath: Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's
        termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
        Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure
        message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total
        message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to
        /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
    terminationMessagePolicy: Indicate how the termination message should be populated.
        File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container
        status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the
        last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and
        the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80
        lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
    tty: Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to
        be true. Default is false.
    workingDir: Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
        default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be
        updated.
    args: Arguments to the entrypoint. The container image's CMD is used if this is not
        provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list

            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.

            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

class EphemeralContainer(HikaruBase):

    An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
    user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
    scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
    removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
    Pod to exceed its resource allocation. To add an ephemeral container, use the
    ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be
    removed or restarted. This is a beta feature available on clusters that haven't
    disabled the EphemeralContainers feature gate.

    Full name: EphemeralContainer

    Attributes:
    name: Name of the ephemeral container specified as a DNS_LABEL. This name must be
        unique among all containers, init containers and ephemeral containers.
    image: Container image name. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images
    imagePullPolicy: Image pull policy. One of Always, Never, IfNotPresent. Defaults to
        Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise. Cannot be updated.
        More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#updating-images
    lifecycle: Lifecycle is not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    livenessProbe: Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    readinessProbe: Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    resources: Resources are not allowed for ephemeral containers. Ephemeral containers
        use spare resources already allocated to the pod.
    securityContext: Optional: SecurityContext defines the security options the ephemeral
        container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the
        equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext.
    startupProbe: Probes are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    stdin: Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container
        runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result
        in EOF. Default is false.
    stdinOnce: Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has
        been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain
        open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened
        on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then
        remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is
        closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false,
        a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is
        false
    targetContainerName: If set, the name of the container from PodSpec that this
        ephemeral container targets. The ephemeral container will be run in the namespaces
        (IPC, PID, etc) of this container. If not set then the ephemeral container uses
        the namespaces configured in the Pod spec. The container runtime must implement
        support for this feature. If the runtime does not support namespace targeting then
        the result of setting this field is undefined.
    terminationMessagePath: Optional: Path at which the file to which the container's
        termination message will be written is mounted into the container's filesystem.
        Message written is intended to be brief final status, such as an assertion failure
        message. Will be truncated by the node if greater than 4096 bytes. The total
        message length across all containers will be limited to 12kb. Defaults to
        /dev/termination-log. Cannot be updated.
    terminationMessagePolicy: Indicate how the termination message should be populated.
        File will use the contents of terminationMessagePath to populate the container
        status message on both success and failure. FallbackToLogsOnError will use the
        last chunk of container log output if the termination message file is empty and
        the container exited with an error. The log output is limited to 2048 bytes or 80
        lines, whichever is smaller. Defaults to File. Cannot be updated.
    tty: Whether this container should allocate a TTY for itself, also requires 'stdin' to
        be true. Default is false.
    workingDir: Container's working directory. If not specified, the container runtime's
        default will be used, which might be configured in the container image. Cannot be
        updated.
    args: Arguments to the entrypoint. The image's CMD is used if this is not provided.
        Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If
        a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be
        unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows for escaping the
        $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal
        "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether
        the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
    command: Entrypoint array. Not executed within a shell. The image's ENTRYPOINT is used
        if this is not provided. Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the
        container's environment. If a variable cannot be resolved, the reference in the
        input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced to a single $, which allows
        for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string
        literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of

        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#running-a-command-in-a-shell
    env: List of environment variables to set in the container. Cannot be updated.
    envFrom: List of sources to populate environment variables in the container. The keys
        defined within a source must be a C_IDENTIFIER. All invalid keys will be reported
        as an event when the container is starting. When a key exists in multiple sources,
        the value associated with the last source will take precedence. Values defined by
        an Env with a duplicate key will take precedence. Cannot be updated.
    ports: Ports are not allowed for ephemeral containers.
    volumeDevices: volumeDevices is the list of block devices to be used by the container.
    volumeMounts: Pod volumes to mount into the container's filesystem. Subpath mounts are
        not allowed for ephemeral containers. Cannot be updated.

        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the

        be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the name from the

        concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long). An existing PVC
        with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to
        avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the
        pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod
        exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually
        reconstructing a broken cluster. This field is read-only and no changes will be

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient

            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed

            entity that is making these changes. The value must be less than or

            duplicate fields, provided that the `ServerSideFieldValidation`
            feature gate is also enabled. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will
            ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object,
            and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder
            encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23 and is the
            default behavior when the `ServerSideFieldValidation` feature gate
            is disabled. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard
            warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from
            the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The
            request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will
            only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default
            when the `ServerSideFieldValidation` feature gate is enabled. -
            Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any
            unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate
            fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain
            all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and

            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

    Attributes:
    active: Active reports the checkpointed config the node is actively using. Active will
        represent either the current version of the Assigned config, or the current

        results in an error.
    assigned: Assigned reports the checkpointed config the node will try to use. When
        Node.Spec.ConfigSource is updated, the node checkpoints the associated config
        payload to local disk, along with a record indicating intended config. The node
        refers to this record to choose its config checkpoint, and reports this record in
        Assigned. Assigned only updates in the status after the record has been
        checkpointed to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted, it tries to make the Assigned
        config the Active config by loading and validating the checkpointed payload
        identified by Assigned.
    error: Error describes any problems reconciling the Spec.ConfigSource to the Active
        config. Errors may occur, for example, attempting to checkpoint Spec.ConfigSource
        to the local Assigned record, attempting to checkpoint the payload associated with
        Spec.ConfigSource, attempting to load or validate the Assigned config, etc. Errors
        may occur at different points while syncing config. Earlier errors (e.g. download
        or checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and may
        resolve across Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g. loading or validating a
        checkpointed config) will result in a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter
        case, it is usually possible to resolve the error by fixing the config assigned in
        Spec.ConfigSource. You can find additional information for debugging by searching
        the error message in the Kubelet log. Error is a human-readable description of the
        error state; machines can check whether or not Error is empty, but should not rely
        on the stability of the Error text across Kubelet versions.
    lastKnownGood: LastKnownGood reports the checkpointed config the node will fall back
        to when it encounters an error attempting to use the Assigned config. The Assigned
        config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node determines that the Assigned
        config is stable and correct. This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak
        period starting when the local record of Assigned config is updated. If the
        Assigned config is Active at the end of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood.
        Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use local defaults), the
        LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because the local default config
        is always assumed good. You should not make assumptions about the node's method of
        determining config stability and correctness, as this may change or become
        configurable in the future.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

                the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The
                request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will

                when the `ServerSideFieldValidation` feature gate is enabled. -

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

    PersistentVolumeClaimSpec describes the common attributes of storage devices and
    allows a Source for provider-specific attributes

    Full name: PersistentVolumeClaimSpec

    Attributes:
    dataSource: dataSource field can be used to specify either: * An existing
        VolumeSnapshot object (snapshot.storage.k8s.io/VolumeSnapshot) * An existing PVC
        (PersistentVolumeClaim) If the provisioner or an external controller can support
        the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of
        the specified data source. If the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate is enabled,
        this field will always have the same contents as the DataSourceRef field.
    dataSourceRef: dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume
        with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a
        non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this
        field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified
        object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field
        will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields
        are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both
        fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically
        if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. There are two important
        differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows
        two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well
        as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
        (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a
        disallowed value is specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the
        AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

        RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure feature is enabled users are allowed to specify

        calculation. If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources

        volume capacity is equal or lower than the requested capacity. This is an alpha

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions

            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with

            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

    r"""
    PodSecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common container settings.
    Some fields are also present in container.securityContext. Field values of
    container.securityContext take precedence over field values of PodSecurityContext.

    Full name: PodSecurityContext

    Attributes:
    fsGroup: A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod. Some
        volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume to be owned
        by the pod: 1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup 2. The setgid bit is set (new
        files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup) 3. The permission bits are
        OR'd with rw-rw---- If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and
        permissions of any volume. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is
        windows.
    fsGroupChangePolicy: fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and
        permission of the volume before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only
        apply to volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions). It
        will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps and
        emptydir. Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified,
        "Always" is used. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    runAsGroup: The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime
        default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both
        SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
        takes precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when
        spec.os.name is windows.
    runAsNonRoot: Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the
        Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0
        (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such
        validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both
        SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
        takes precedence.
    runAsUser: The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user
        specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext. If
        set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
        SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot
        be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    seLinuxOptions: The SELinux context to be applied to all containers. If unspecified,
        the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.
        May also be set in SecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for
        that container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    seccompProfile: The seccomp options to use by the containers in this pod. Note that
        this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    windowsOptions: The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If
        unspecified, the options within a container's SecurityContext will be used. If set
        in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
        SecurityContext takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when
        spec.os.name is linux.
    supplementalGroups: A list of groups applied to the first process run in each
        container, in addition to the container's primary GID. If unspecified, no groups
        will be added to any container. Note that this field cannot be set when
        spec.os.name is windows.
    sysctls: Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with
        unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch. Note that
        this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.

    PodSpec is a description of a pod.

    Full name: PodSpec

    Attributes:
    containers: List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be
        added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be
        updated.
    activeDeadlineSeconds: Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node
        relative to StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and
        kill associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.
    affinity: If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints
    automountServiceAccountToken: AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service
        account token should be automatically mounted.
    dnsConfig: Specifies the DNS parameters of a pod. Parameters specified here will be
        merged to the generated DNS configuration based on DNSPolicy.
    dnsPolicy: Set DNS policy for the pod. Defaults to "ClusterFirst". Valid values are
        'ClusterFirstWithHostNet', 'ClusterFirst', 'Default' or 'None'. DNS parameters
        given in DNSConfig will be merged with the policy selected with DNSPolicy. To have
        DNS options set along with hostNetwork, you have to specify DNS policy explicitly
        to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.
    enableServiceLinks: EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services
        should be injected into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker
        links. Optional: Defaults to true.
    hostIPC: Use the host's ipc namespace. Optional: Default to false.
    hostNetwork: Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host's network namespace.
        If this option is set, the ports that will be used must be specified. Default to
        false.
    hostPID: Use the host's pid namespace. Optional: Default to false.
    hostname: Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's hostname will
        be set to a system-defined value.
    nodeName: NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is
        non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming that
        it fits resource requirements.
    os: Specifies the OS of the containers in the pod. Some pod and container fields are
        restricted if this is set. If the OS field is set to linux, the following fields
        must be unset: -securityContext.windowsOptions If the OS field is set to windows,
        following fields must be unset: - spec.hostPID - spec.hostIPC -
        spec.securityContext.seLinuxOptions - spec.securityContext.seccompProfile -
        spec.securityContext.fsGroup - spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy -
        spec.securityContext.sysctls - spec.shareProcessNamespace -
        spec.securityContext.runAsUser - spec.securityContext.runAsGroup -
        spec.securityContext.supplementalGroups -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.seLinuxOptions -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.seccompProfile -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.capabilities -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.privileged -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.procMount -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.runAsUser -
        spec.containers[*].securityContext.runAsGroup This is a beta field and requires
        the IdentifyPodOS feature
    preemptionPolicy: PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with lower
        priority. One of Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to PreemptLowerPriority if
        unset.
    priority: The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the
        priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents
        users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from
        PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.
    priorityClassName: If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical"
        and "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the highest
        priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be
        defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the
        pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.
    restartPolicy: Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of Always,
        OnFailure, Never. Default to Always. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy
    runtimeClassName: RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io
        group, which should be used to run this pod. If no RuntimeClass resource matches
        the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy"
        RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition
        that uses the default runtime handler. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/585-runtime-class
    schedulerName: If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not
        specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
    securityContext: SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and common
        container settings. Optional: Defaults to empty. See type description for default
        values of each field.
    serviceAccount: DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for
        ServiceAccountName. Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.
    serviceAccountName: ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount to use to run
        this pod. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/
    setHostnameAsFQDN: If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN,
        rather than the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting
        the FQDN in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct
        utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname
        for the registry key
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters to FQDN. If
        a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.
    shareProcessNamespace: Share a single process namespace between all of the containers
        in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes
        from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container
        will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set.
        Optional: Default to false.
    subdomain: If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be
        "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not specified,
        the pod will not have a domainname at all.
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds: Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate
        gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative
        integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no
        opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be
        used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes
        running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes
        are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected
        cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.
    ephemeralContainers: List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral
        containers may be run in an existing pod to perform user-initiated actions such as
        debugging. This list cannot be specified when creating a pod, and it cannot be
        modified by updating the pod spec. In order to add an ephemeral container to an
        existing pod, use the pod's ephemeralcontainers subresource. This field is
        beta-level and available on clusters that haven't disabled the EphemeralContainers
        feature gate.
    hostAliases: HostAliases is an optional list of hosts and IPs that will be injected
        into the pod's hosts file if specified. This is only valid for non-hostNetwork
        pods.
    imagePullSecrets: ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the
        same namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If
        specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller implementations for
        them to use. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod
    initContainers: List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init
        containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init
        container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to
        its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
        unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions,
        Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of
        an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest
        request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of that value or
        the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers in a
        similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or removed. Cannot be
        updated. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/
    nodeSelector: NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a
        node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on
        that node. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/
    overhead: Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for
        a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission time by the
        RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission controller is
        enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The RuntimeClass
        admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have the overhead
        already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the PodSpec, Overhead
        will be set to the value defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass, otherwise it
        will remain unset and treated as zero. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/688-pod-overhead/README.md
    readinessGates: If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness.
        A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in
        the readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/580-pod-readiness-gates
    tolerations: If specified, the pod's tolerations.
    topologySpreadConstraints: TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods
        ought to spread across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way
        which abides by the constraints. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.
    volumes: List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod. More

class PodStatus(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    PodStatus represents information about the status of a pod. Status may trail the
    actual state of a system, especially if the node that hosts the pod cannot contact the
    control plane.

    Full name: PodStatus

    Attributes:
    hostIP: IP address of the host to which the pod is assigned. Empty if not yet
        scheduled.
    message: A human readable message indicating details about why the pod is in this
        condition.
    nominatedNodeName: nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on
        the node, but it cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive
        their graceful termination periods. This field does not guarantee that the pod
        will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod elsewhere if
        other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to give the
        resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption.
        As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is
        scheduled.
    phase: The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its
        lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual
        container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status. There are five
        possible phase values: Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes
        system, but one or more of the container images has not been created. This
        includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over
        the network, which could take a while. Running: The pod has been bound to a node,
        and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still
        running, or is in the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers
        in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All
        containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated
        in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by
        the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained,
        typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-phase
    podIP: IP address allocated to the pod. Routable at least within the cluster. Empty if
        not yet allocated.
    qosClass: The Quality of Service (QOS) classification assigned to the pod based on
        resource requirements See PodQOSClass type for available QOS classes More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/design-proposals/node/resource-qos.md
    reason: A brief CamelCase message indicating details about why the pod is in this
        state. e.g. 'Evicted'
    startTime: RFC 3339 date and time at which the object was acknowledged by the Kubelet.
        This is before the Kubelet pulled the container image(s) for the pod.
    conditions: Current service state of pod. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-conditions
    containerStatuses: The list has one entry per container in the manifest. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-and-container-status
    ephemeralContainerStatuses: Status for any ephemeral containers that have run in this
        pod. This field is beta-level and available on clusters that haven't disabled the
        EphemeralContainers feature gate.
    initContainerStatuses: The list has one entry per init container in the manifest. The
        most recent successful init container will have ready = true, the most recently
        started container will have startTime set. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#pod-and-container-status
    podIPs: podIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the pod. If this field is
        specified, the 0th entry must match the podIP field. Pods may be allocated at most
        1 value for each of IPv4 and IPv6. This list is empty if no IPs have been
        allocated yet.

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value

        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that

            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes

            encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23 and is the
            default behavior when the `ServerSideFieldValidation` feature gate
            is disabled. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard
            warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from
            the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The
            request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will
            only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default
            when the `ServerSideFieldValidation` feature gate is enabled. -
            Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any
            unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate
            fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain
            all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients

            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        be modified at any time. Defaulted to nil.
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

    allowPrivilegeEscalation: AllowPrivilegeEscalation controls whether a process can gain
        more privileges than its parent process. This bool directly controls if the

        is true always when the container is: 1) run as Privileged 2) has CAP_SYS_ADMIN
        Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    capabilities: The capabilities to add/drop when running containers. Defaults to the
        default set of capabilities granted by the container runtime. Note that this field
        cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    privileged: Run container in privileged mode. Processes in privileged containers are
        essentially equivalent to root on the host. Defaults to false. Note that this
        field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    procMount: procMount denotes the type of proc mount to use for the containers. The
        default is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for readonly
        paths and masked paths. This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be
        enabled. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: Whether this container has a read-only root filesystem.
        Default is false. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    runAsGroup: The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime
        default if unset. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both
        SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
        takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    runAsNonRoot: Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the
        Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0
        (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such
        validation will be performed. May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in

    runAsUser: The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user
        specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in PodSecurityContext.
        If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in
        SecurityContext takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when
        spec.os.name is windows.
    seLinuxOptions: The SELinux context to be applied to the container. If unspecified,
        the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.
        May also be set in PodSecurityContext. If set in both SecurityContext and
        PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. Note
        that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    seccompProfile: The seccomp options to use by this container. If seccomp options are
        provided at both the pod & container level, the container options override the pod
        options. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
    windowsOptions: The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If
        unspecified, the options from the PodSecurityContext will be used. If set in both

    Full name: ServiceAccount

    Attributes:
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
        object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value,
        and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    automountServiceAccountToken: AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether pods
        running as this service account should have an API token automatically mounted.
        Can be overridden at the pod level.
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be
        updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    metadata: Standard object's metadata. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    imagePullSecrets: ImagePullSecrets is a list of references to secrets in the same
        namespace to use for pulling any images in pods that reference this
        ServiceAccount. ImagePullSecrets are distinct from Secrets because Secrets can be
        mounted in the pod, but ImagePullSecrets are only accessed by the kubelet. More
        info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod
    secrets: Secrets is a list of the secrets in the same namespace that pods running
        using this ServiceAccount are allowed to use. Pods are only limited to this list
        if this service account has a "kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets" annotation
        set to "true". This field should not be used to find auto-generated service
        account token secrets for use outside of pods. Instead, tokens can be requested
        directly using the TokenRequest API, or service account token secrets can be
        manually created. More info:

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See

            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

        mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
    name: The name of this port within the service. This must be a DNS_LABEL. All ports
        within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering the endpoints for a
        Service, this must match the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only
        one ServicePort is defined on this service.
    nodePort: The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort
        or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified,
        in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail. If
        not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this
        field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will
        fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g.
        changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP). More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport
    protocol: The IP protocol for this port. Supports "TCP", "UDP", and "SCTP". Default is
        TCP.
    targetPort: Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service.
        Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. If this is
        a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container
        ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used (an
        identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should
        be omitted or set equal to the 'port' field. More info:

@dataclass
class ServiceSpec(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    ServiceSpec describes the attributes that a user creates on a service.

    Full name: ServiceSpec

    Attributes:
    allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts: allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts defines if NodePorts will
        be automatically allocated for services with type LoadBalancer. Default is "true".
        It may be set to "false" if the cluster load-balancer does not rely on NodePorts.
        If the caller requests specific NodePorts (by specifying a value), those requests
        will be respected, regardless of this field. This field may only be set for
        services with type LoadBalancer and will be cleared if the type is changed to any
        other type.
    clusterIP: clusterIP is the IP address of the service and is usually assigned
        randomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as per system
        configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service; otherwise
        creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through updates
        unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which requires this
        field to be blank) or the type field is being changed from ExternalName (in which
        case this field may optionally be specified, as describe above). Valid values are
        "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address. Setting this to "None" makes a
        "headless service" (no virtual IP), which is useful when direct endpoint
        connections are preferred and proxying is not required. Only applies to types
        ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified when creating a
        Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when
        updating a Service to type ExternalName. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    externalName: externalName is the external reference that discovery mechanisms will
        return as an alias for this service (e.g. a DNS CNAME record). No proxying will be
        involved. Must be a lowercase RFC-1123 hostname
        (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires `type` to be "ExternalName".
    externalTrafficPolicy: externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service desires to route
        external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. "Local" preserves the
        client source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer and Nodeport type
        services, but risks potentially imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster" obscures
        the client source IP and may cause a second hop to another node, but should have
        good overall load-spreading.
    healthCheckNodePort: healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck nodePort for the
        service. This only applies when type is set to LoadBalancer and
        externalTrafficPolicy is set to Local. If a value is specified, is in-range, and
        is not in use, it will be used. If not specified, a value will be automatically
        allocated. External systems (e.g. load-balancers) can use this port to determine
        if a given node holds endpoints for this service or not. If this field is
        specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This
        field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing
        type).
    internalTrafficPolicy: InternalTrafficPolicy specifies if the cluster internal traffic
        should be routed to all endpoints or node-local endpoints only. "Cluster" routes
        internal traffic to a Service to all endpoints. "Local" routes traffic to
        node-local endpoints only, traffic is dropped if no node-local endpoints are
        ready. The default value is "Cluster".
    ipFamilyPolicy: IPFamilyPolicy represents the dual-stack-ness requested or required by
        this Service. If there is no value provided, then this field will be set to
        SingleStack. Services can be "SingleStack" (a single IP family), "PreferDualStack"
        (two IP families on dual-stack configured clusters or a single IP family on
        single-stack clusters), or "RequireDualStack" (two IP families on dual-stack
        configured clusters, otherwise fail). The ipFamilies and clusterIPs fields depend
        on the value of this field. This field will be wiped when updating a service to
        type ExternalName.
    loadBalancerClass: loadBalancerClass is the class of the load balancer implementation
        this Service belongs to. If specified, the value of this field must be a
        label-style identifier, with an optional prefix, e.g. "internal-vip" or
        "example.com/internal-vip". Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users. This
        field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the
        default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through
        the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default implementation.
        If set, it is assumed that a load balancer implementation is watching for Services
        with a matching class. Any default load balancer implementation (e.g. cloud
        providers) should ignore Services that set this field. This field can only be set
        when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'. Once set, it can not
        be changed. This field will be wiped when a service is updated to a non
        'LoadBalancer' type.
    loadBalancerIP: Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer. This feature depends on
        whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP when
        a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does
        not support the feature. Deprecated: This field was under-specified and its
        meaning varies across implementations, and it cannot support dual-stack. As of
        Kubernetes v1.24, users are encouraged to use implementation-specific annotations
        when available. This field may be removed in a future API version.
    publishNotReadyAddresses: publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which
        deals with endpoints for this Service should disregard any indications of
        ready/not-ready. The primary use case for setting this field is for a
        StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the
        purpose of peer discovery. The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and
        EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are
        considered "ready" even if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only
        Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources
        can safely assume this behavior.
    sessionAffinity: Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session affinity.
        Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. Defaults to
        None. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    sessionAffinityConfig: sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations of session
        affinity.
    type: type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid options
        are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. "ClusterIP" allocates a
        cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are
        determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction of
        an Endpoints object or EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual
        IP is allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than
        a virtual IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node
        which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on
        NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud)
        which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP. "ExternalName" aliases this
        service to the specified externalName. Several other fields do not apply to
        ExternalName services. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types
    clusterIPs: ClusterIPs is a list of IP addresses assigned to this service, and are
        usually assigned randomly. If an address is specified manually, is in-range (as
        per system configuration), and is not in use, it will be allocated to the service;
        otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field may not be changed through
        updates unless the type field is also being changed to ExternalName (which
        requires this field to be empty) or the type field is being changed from
        ExternalName (in which case this field may optionally be specified, as describe
        above). Valid values are "None", empty string (""), or a valid IP address. Setting
        this to "None" makes a "headless service" (no virtual IP), which is useful when
        direct endpoint connections are preferred and proxying is not required. Only
        applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. If this field is specified
        when creating a Service of type ExternalName, creation will fail. This field will
        be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName. If this field is not
        specified, it will be initialized from the clusterIP field. If this field is
        specified, clients must ensure that clusterIPs[0] and clusterIP have the same
        value. This field may hold a maximum of two entries (dual-stack IPs, in either
        order). These IPs must correspond to the values of the ipFamilies field. Both
        clusterIPs and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    externalIPs: externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will
        also accept traffic for this service. These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes. The
        user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP. A
        common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes
        system.
    ipFamilies: IPFamilies is a list of IP families (e.g. IPv4, IPv6) assigned to this
        service. This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster
        configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified manually,
        the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it
        will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field is
        conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but
        it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are
        "IPv4" and "IPv6". This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP,
        NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to "headless" services. This field will
        be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName. This field may hold a
        maximum of two entries (dual-stack families, in either order). These families must
        correspond to the values of the clusterIPs field, if specified. Both clusterIPs
        and ipFamilies are governed by the ipFamilyPolicy field.
    loadBalancerSourceRanges: If specified and supported by the platform, this will
        restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be restricted to
        the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the cloud-provider does
        not support the feature." More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/
    ports: The list of ports that are exposed by this service. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies
    selector: Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching this
        selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an external
        process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. Only applies to
        types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type is ExternalName. More

class TopologySpreadConstraint(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given

    Full name: TopologySpreadConstraint

    Attributes:
    maxSkew: MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When
        `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between
        the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The
        global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or
        zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a
        3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread
        as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P |
        P P | P | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become
        2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on
        zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled
        onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher
        precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is
        1 and 0 is not allowed.
    topologyKey: TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this
        key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider
        each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each
        bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define
        an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes match the node selector. e.g. If
        TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
        And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of
        that topology. It's a required field.
    whenUnsatisfiable: WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't
        satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not
        to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any
        location, but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
        skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only
        if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some
        topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the
        same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P | P | P | If
        WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to
        zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
        won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.
    labelSelector: LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label
        selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding
        topology domain.
    minDomains: MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number
        of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod
        Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is
        performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys
        equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a
        result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler
        won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the
        constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers
        greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and
        pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P
        | P P | P P | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global
        minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
        cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is
        scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. This is an alpha
        field and requires enabling MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate.

    name: name of the volume. Must be a DNS_LABEL and unique within the pod. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
    awsElasticBlockStore: awsElasticBlockStore represents an AWS Disk resource that is
        attached to a kubelet's host machine and then exposed to the pod. More info:

        info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes#emptydir
    ephemeral: ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created
        before the pod starts, and deleted when the pod is removed. Use this if: a) the
        volume is only needed while the pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like
        restoring from snapshot or capacity tracking are needed, c) the storage driver is
        specified through a storage class, and d) the storage driver supports dynamic
        volume provisioning through a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for
        more information on the connection between this volume type and
        PersistentVolumeClaim). Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod.
        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to be
        used that way - see the documentation of the driver for more information. A pod
        can use both types of ephemeral volumes and persistent volumes at the same time.

            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and

            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client

            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and

            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and

            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client

            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

    Full name: IngressRule

    Attributes:
    host: Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC
        3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as defined in
        RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to
        the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The `:` delimiter is not respected
        because ports are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80
        for http and :443 for https. Both these may change in the future. Incoming
        requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is
        unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified
        IngressRuleValue. Host can be "precise" which is a domain name without the
        terminating dot of a network host (e.g. "foo.bar.com") or "wildcard", which is a
        domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. "*.foo.com"). The wildcard
        character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a
        single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == "*").
        Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way: 1. If Host
        is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to
        Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http
        host header is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard
        rule.

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource

            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that

            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See

            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

@dataclass
class CSIDriverSpec(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    CSIDriverSpec is the specification of a CSIDriver.

    Full name: CSIDriverSpec

    Attributes:
    attachRequired: attachRequired indicates this CSI volume driver requires an attach
        operation (because it implements the CSI ControllerPublishVolume() method), and
        that the Kubernetes attach detach controller should call the attach volume
        interface which checks the volumeattachment status and waits until the volume is
        attached before proceeding to mounting. The CSI external-attacher coordinates with
        CSI volume driver and updates the volumeattachment status when the attach
        operation is complete. If the CSIDriverRegistry feature gate is enabled and the
        value is specified to false, the attach operation will be skipped. Otherwise the
        attach operation will be called. This field is immutable.
    fsGroupPolicy: Defines if the underlying volume supports changing ownership and
        permission of the volume before being mounted. Refer to the specific FSGroupPolicy
        values for additional details. This field is immutable. Defaults to
        ReadWriteOnceWithFSType, which will examine each volume to determine if Kubernetes
        should modify ownership and permissions of the volume. With the default policy the
        defined fsGroup will only be applied if a fstype is defined and the volume's
        access mode contains ReadWriteOnce.
    podInfoOnMount: If set to true, podInfoOnMount indicates this CSI volume driver
        requires additional pod information (like podName, podUID, etc.) during mount
        operations. If set to false, pod information will not be passed on mount. Default
        is false. The CSI driver specifies podInfoOnMount as part of driver deployment. If
        true, Kubelet will pass pod information as VolumeContext in the CSI
        NodePublishVolume() calls. The CSI driver is responsible for parsing and
        validating the information passed in as VolumeContext. The following VolumeConext
        will be passed if podInfoOnMount is set to true. This list might grow, but the
        prefix will be used. "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.name": pod.Name
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.namespace": pod.Namespace "csi.storage.k8s.io/pod.uid":
        string(pod.UID) "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral": "true" if the volume is an
        ephemeral inline volume defined by a CSIVolumeSource, otherwise "false"
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/ephemeral" is a new feature in Kubernetes 1.16. It is only
        required for drivers which support both the "Persistent" and "Ephemeral"
        VolumeLifecycleMode. Other drivers can leave pod info disabled and/or ignore this
        field. As Kubernetes 1.15 doesn't support this field, drivers can only support one
        mode when deployed on such a cluster and the deployment determines which mode that
        is, for example via a command line parameter of the driver. This field is
        immutable.
    requiresRepublish: RequiresRepublish indicates the CSI driver wants
        `NodePublishVolume` being periodically called to reflect any possible change in
        the mounted volume. This field defaults to false. Note: After a successful initial
        NodePublishVolume call, subsequent calls to NodePublishVolume should only update
        the contents of the volume. New mount points will not be seen by a running
        container.
    storageCapacity: If set to true, storageCapacity indicates that the CSI volume driver
        wants pod scheduling to consider the storage capacity that the driver deployment
        will report by creating CSIStorageCapacity objects with capacity information. The
        check can be enabled immediately when deploying a driver. In that case,
        provisioning new volumes with late binding will pause until the driver deployment
        has published some suitable CSIStorageCapacity object. Alternatively, the driver
        can be deployed with the field unset or false and it can be flipped later when
        storage capacity information has been published. This field was immutable in
        Kubernetes <= 1.22 and now is mutable.
    tokenRequests: TokenRequests indicates the CSI driver needs pods' service account
        tokens it is mounting volume for to do necessary authentication. Kubelet will pass
        the tokens in VolumeContext in the CSI NodePublishVolume calls. The CSI driver
        should parse and validate the following VolumeContext:
        "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens": { "<audience>": { "token": <token>,
        "expirationTimestamp": <expiration timestamp in RFC3339>, }, ... } Note: Audience
        in each TokenRequest should be different and at most one token is empty string. To
        receive a new token after expiry, RequiresRepublish can be used to trigger
        NodePublishVolume periodically.
    volumeLifecycleModes: volumeLifecycleModes defines what kind of volumes this CSI
        volume driver supports. The default if the list is empty is "Persistent", which is
        the usage defined by the CSI specification and implemented in Kubernetes via the
        usual PV/PVC mechanism. The other mode is "Ephemeral". In this mode, volumes are
        defined inline inside the pod spec with CSIVolumeSource and their lifecycle is
        tied to the lifecycle of that pod. A driver has to be aware of this because it is
        only going to get a NodePublishVolume call for such a volume. For more information
        about implementing this mode, see
        https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/ephemeral-local-volumes.html A driver can
        support one or more of these modes and more modes may be added in the future. This
        field is beta. This field is immutable.

class CSINode(HikaruDocumentBase):
    r"""
    CSINode holds information about all CSI drivers installed on a node. CSI drivers do
    not need to create the CSINode object directly. As long as they use the
    node-driver-registrar sidecar container, the kubelet will automatically populate the
    CSINode object for the CSI driver as part of kubelet plugin registration. CSINode has
    the same name as a node. If the object is missing, it means either there are no CSI
    Drivers available on the node, or the Kubelet version is low enough that it doesn't
    create this object. CSINode has an OwnerReference that points to the corresponding
    node object.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients

            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is

        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by

        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the

class CSIStorageCapacity(HikaruDocumentBase):
    r"""
    CSIStorageCapacity stores the result of one CSI GetCapacity call. For a given
    StorageClass, this describes the available capacity in a particular topology segment.
    This can be used when considering where to instantiate new PersistentVolumes. For
    example this can express things like: - StorageClass "standard" has "1234 GiB"
    available in "topology.kubernetes.io/zone=us-east1" - StorageClass "localssd" has "10
    GiB" available in "kubernetes.io/hostname=knode-abc123" The following three cases all
    imply that no capacity is available for a certain combination: - no object exists with
    suitable topology and storage class name - such an object exists, but the capacity is
    unset - such an object exists, but the capacity is zero The producer of these objects
    can decide which approach is more suitable. They are consumed by the kube-scheduler
    when a CSI driver opts into capacity-aware scheduling with
    CSIDriverSpec.StorageCapacity. The scheduler compares the MaximumVolumeSize against
    the requested size of pending volumes to filter out unsuitable nodes. If
    MaximumVolumeSize is unset, it falls back to a comparison against the less precise
    Capacity. If that is also unset, the scheduler assumes that capacity is insufficient
    and tries some other node.

    Full name: CSIStorageCapacity

    Attributes:
    storageClassName: The name of the StorageClass that the reported capacity applies to.
        It must meet the same requirements as the name of a StorageClass object

        size that may be used in a CreateVolumeRequest.capacity_range.required_bytes field
        to create a volume with the same parameters as those in GetCapacityRequest. The
        corresponding value in the Kubernetes API is ResourceRequirements.Requests in a
        volume claim.
    metadata: Standard object's metadata. The name has no particular meaning. It must be
        be a DNS subdomain (dots allowed, 253 characters). To ensure that there are no
        conflicts with other CSI drivers on the cluster, the recommendation is to use
        csisc-<uuid>, a generated name, or a reverse-domain name which ends with the
        unique CSI driver name. Objects are namespaced. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    nodeTopology: NodeTopology defines which nodes have access to the storage for which
        capacity was reported. If not set, the storage is not accessible from any node in
        the cluster. If empty, the storage is accessible from all nodes. This field is
        immutable.

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See

class StorageClass(HikaruDocumentBase):
    r"""
    StorageClass describes the parameters for a class of storage for which
    PersistentVolumes can be dynamically provisioned. StorageClasses are non-namespaced;
    the name of the storage class according to etcd is in ObjectMeta.Name.

    Full name: StorageClass

    Attributes:
    provisioner: Provisioner indicates the type of the provisioner.
    allowVolumeExpansion: AllowVolumeExpansion shows whether the storage class allow
        volume expand
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
        object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value,
        and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be
        updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
    metadata: Standard object's metadata. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    reclaimPolicy: Dynamically provisioned PersistentVolumes of this storage class are
        created with this reclaimPolicy. Defaults to Delete.
    volumeBindingMode: VolumeBindingMode indicates how PersistentVolumeClaims should be
        provisioned and bound. When unset, VolumeBindingImmediate is used. This field is
        only honored by servers that enable the VolumeScheduling feature.
    allowedTopologies: Restrict the node topologies where volumes can be dynamically
        provisioned. Each volume plugin defines its own supported topology specifications.
        An empty TopologySelectorTerm list means there is no topology restriction. This
        field is only honored by servers that enable the VolumeScheduling feature.
    mountOptions: Dynamically provisioned PersistentVolumes of this storage class are
        created with these mountOptions, e.g. ["ro", "soft"]. Not validated - mount of the
        PVs will simply fail if one is invalid.
    parameters: Parameters holds the parameters for the provisioner that should create
        volumes of this storage class.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.

        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.

        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended

            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.

            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.

        apiVersion and metadata are validated automatically.
        x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is allowed to be true, but does not have to
        be if the object is fully specified (up to kind, apiVersion, metadata).
    x_kubernetes_int_or_string: x-kubernetes-int-or-string specifies that this value is

        lists will be entirely replaced when updated. This extension may be used on any
        type of list (struct, scalar, ...). 2) `set`: Sets are lists that must not have
        multiple items with the same value. Each value must be a scalar, an object with
        x-kubernetes-map-type `atomic` or an array with x-kubernetes-list-type `atomic`.

    x_kubernetes_map_type: x-kubernetes-map-type annotates an object to further describe
        its topology. This extension must only be used when type is object and may have 2
        possible values: 1) `granular`: These maps are actual maps (key-value pairs) and
        each fields are independent from each other (they can each be manipulated by
        separate actors). This is the default behaviour for all maps. 2) `atomic`: the
        list is treated as a single entity, like a scalar. Atomic maps will be entirely
        replaced when updated.
    x_kubernetes_preserve_unknown_fields: x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields stops the
        API server decoding step from pruning fields which are not specified in the
        validation schema. This affects fields recursively, but switches back to normal
        pruning behaviour if nested properties or additionalProperties are specified in

class ValidationRule(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    ValidationRule describes a validation rule written in the CEL expression language.

    Full name: ValidationRule

    Attributes:
    rule: Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref:
        https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the
        x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL
        expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a
        resource with a status subresource: {"rule": "self.status.actual <=
        self.spec.maxDesired"} If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the
        accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and
        field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are
        treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object
        with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via
        `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all
        entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as
        `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are
        accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped
        to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map
        of objects: {"rule": "self.components['Widget'].priority < 10"} - Rule scoped to a
        list of integers: {"rule": "self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)"} -
        Rule scoped to a string value: {"rule": "self.startsWith('kube')"} The
        `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always
        accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource
        annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible. Unknown data
        preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not
        accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are
        preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object
        properties where the property schema is of an "unknown type". An "unknown type" is
        recursively defined as: - A schema with no type and
        x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true - An array where the items schema
        is of an "unknown type" - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an
        "unknown type" Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are
        accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules
        when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes
        to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property
        names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The
        keywords are: "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue",
        "else", "for", "function", "if", "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace",
        "return". Examples: - Rule accessing a property named "namespace": {"rule":
        "self.__namespace__ > 0"} - Rule accessing a property named "x-prop": {"rule":
        "self.x__dash__prop > 0"} - Rule accessing a property named "redact__d": {"rule":
        "self.redact__underscores__d > 0"} Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type
        of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on
        arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type: - 'set': `X
        + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are
        preserved and non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their
        partial order. - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all
        keys in `X` are preserved but the values are overwritten by values in `Y` when the
        key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with non-intersecting keys are
        appended, retaining their partial order.
    message: Message represents the message displayed when validation fails. The message
        is required if the Rule contains line breaks. The message must not contain line
        breaks. If unset, the message is "failed rule: {Rule}". e.g. "must be a URL with
        the host matching spec.host"

    ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource
    that the fieldset applies to.

    Full name: ManagedFieldsEntry

    Attributes:
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set
        applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion
        field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be
        automatically converted.
    fieldsType: FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and
        version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"
    manager: Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
    operation: Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry
        being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
    subresource: Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object, or
        empty string if the object was updated through the main resource. The value of
        this field is used to distinguish between managers, even if they share the same
        name. For example, a status update will be distinct from a regular update using
        the same manager name. Note that the APIVersion field is not related to the
        Subresource field and it always corresponds to the version of the main resource.
    time: Time is the timestamp of when the ManagedFields entry was added. The timestamp
        will also be updated if a field is added, the manager changes any of the owned
        fields value or removes a field. The timestamp does not update when a field is
        removed from the entry because another manager took it over.
    fieldsV1: FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the "FieldsV1"
        type.

class ObjectMeta(HikaruBase):
    r"""
    ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all
    objects users must create.

    Full name: ObjectMeta

    Attributes:
    clusterName: Deprecated: ClusterName is a legacy field that was always cleared by the
        system and never used; it will be removed completely in 1.25. The name in the go
        struct is changed to help clients detect accidental use.
    creationTimestamp: CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when
        this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order
        across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in
        RFC3339 form and is in UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists.
        More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    deletionGracePeriodSeconds: Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully
        terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when
        deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
    deletionTimestamp: DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource
        will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
        requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is
        expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable
        by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long
        as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the
        deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
        future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
        time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The
        Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in
        the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
        (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the
        presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp,
        until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully
        terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.
        Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More
        info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
    generateName: GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a
        unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used,
        the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value
        will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same
        validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the
        suffix required to make the value unique on the server. If this field is specified
        and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409. Applied only if Name
        is not specified. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency
    generation: A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state.
        Populated by the system. Read-only.
    name: Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources,
        although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an
        appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation
        idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
    namespace: Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty
        namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical
        representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the
        value of this field for those objects will be empty. Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot
        be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
    resourceVersion: An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object
        that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used
        for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a
        resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed
        unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or
        set of resources. Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as
        opaque by clients and . More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
    selfLink: Deprecated: selfLink is a legacy read-only field that is no longer populated
        by the system.
    uid: UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically
        generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to
        change on PUT operations. Populated by the system. Read-only. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
    annotations: Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that
        may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are
        not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
    finalizers: Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry
        is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the
        list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can
        only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order. Order is
        NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers.
        finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the
        finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which
        the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a
        signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component
        responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without
        enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not
        vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
    labels: Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize
        (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and
        services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
    managedFields: ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that
        are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users
        typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the
        user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like
        "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when
        modifying the object.
    ownerReferences: List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list
        have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is
        managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller,
        with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing
        controller.

            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.

        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke

    APIServiceSpec contains information for locating and communicating with a server. Only

    Full name: APIServiceSpec

    Attributes:
    groupPriorityMinimum: GroupPriorityMininum is the priority this group should have at
        least. Higher priority means that the group is preferred by clients over lower
        priority ones. Note that other versions of this group might specify even higher
        GroupPriorityMininum values such that the whole group gets a higher priority. The
        primary sort is based on GroupPriorityMinimum, ordered highest number to lowest
        (20 before 10). The secondary sort is based on the alphabetical comparison of the
        name of the object. (v1.bar before v1.foo) We'd recommend something like: *.k8s.io
        (except extensions) at 18000 and PaaSes (OpenShift, Deis) are recommended to be in
        the 2000s
    versionPriority: VersionPriority controls the ordering of this API version inside of
        its group. Must be greater than zero. The primary sort is based on
        VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's inside of a
        group, the number can be small, probably in the 10s. In case of equal version
        priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group.
        If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version
        strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a
        "v", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string
        "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first
        by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha),
        and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of
        versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1,
        foo10.

    service: service is a reference to the service for this webhook. Either service or url

    url: url gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form
        (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be specified.
        The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use the `service`
        field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some apiservers
        (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering
        violation). `host` may also be an IP address. Please note that using `localhost`
        or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook
        on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this
        webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy to turn up in
        a new cluster. The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://". A
        path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may
        use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example, a cluster
        identifier. Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not
        allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed, either.

class Event(HikaruDocumentBase):
    r"""
    Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster. It generally denotes some
    state change in the system. Events have a limited retention time and triggers and
    messages may evolve with time. Event consumers should not rely on the timing of an
    event with a given Reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued
    existence of events with that Reason. Events should be treated as informative,
    best-effort, supplemental data.

    Full name: Event

    Attributes:
    eventTime: eventTime is the time when this Event was first observed. It is required.
    action: action is what action was taken/failed regarding to the regarding object. It
        is machine-readable. This field cannot be empty for new Events and it can have at
        most 128 characters.
    apiVersion: APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
        object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value,
        and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    deprecatedCount: deprecatedCount is the deprecated field assuring backward
        compatibility with core.v1 Event type.
    deprecatedFirstTimestamp: deprecatedFirstTimestamp is the deprecated field assuring
        backward compatibility with core.v1 Event type.
    deprecatedLastTimestamp: deprecatedLastTimestamp is the deprecated field assuring
        backward compatibility with core.v1 Event type.
    deprecatedSource: deprecatedSource is the deprecated field assuring backward
        compatibility with core.v1 Event type.
    kind: Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be

    note: note is a human-readable description of the status of this operation. Maximal
        length of the note is 1kB, but libraries should be prepared to handle values up to
        64kB.
    reason: reason is why the action was taken. It is human-readable. This field cannot be
        empty for new Events and it can have at most 128 characters.
    regarding: regarding contains the object this Event is about. In most cases it's an
        Object reporting controller implements, e.g. ReplicaSetController implements
        ReplicaSets and this event is emitted because it acts on some changes in a
        ReplicaSet object.
    related: related is the optional secondary object for more complex actions. E.g. when
        regarding object triggers a creation or deletion of related object.
    reportingController: reportingController is the name of the controller that emitted
        this Event, e.g. `kubernetes.io/kubelet`. This field cannot be empty for new

        :param namespace: namespace for the resource
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See

            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where

            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.
