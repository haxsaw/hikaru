        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes

            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset

        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a

            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param dry_run: When present, indicates that modifications should not be
            persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result
            in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid
            values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param grace_period_seconds: The duration in seconds before the object should
            be deleted. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero
            indicates delete immediately. If this value is nil, the default
            grace period for the specified type will be used. Defaults to a per
            object value if not specified. zero means delete immediately.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param orphan_dependents: Deprecated: please use the PropagationPolicy, this
            field will be deprecated in 1.7. Should the dependent objects be
            orphaned. If true/false, the "orphan" finalizer will be added
            to/removed from the object's finalizers list. Either this field or
            PropagationPolicy may be set, but not both.
        :param propagation_policy: Whether and how garbage collection will be
            performed. Either this field or OrphanDependents may be set, but not
            both. The default policy is decided by the existing finalizer set in
            the metadata.finalizers and the resource-specific default policy.
            Acceptable values are: 'Orphan' - orphan the dependents;
            'Background' - allow the garbage collector to delete the dependents
            in the background; 'Foreground' - a cascading policy that deletes
            all dependents in the foreground.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param body:
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient

        :param allow_watch_bookmarks: allowWatchBookmarks requests watch events with
            type "BOOKMARK". Servers that do not implement bookmarks may ignore
            this flag and bookmarks are sent at the server's discretion. Clients
            should not assume bookmarks are returned at any specific interval,
            nor may they assume the server will send any BOOKMARK event during a
            session. If this is not a watch, this field is ignored.
        :param continue_: The continue option should be set when retrieving more
            results from the server. Since this value is server defined, clients
            may only use the continue value from a previous query result with
            identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and
            the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. If the
            specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to
            expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration
            change on the server, the server will respond with a 410
            ResourceExpired error together with a continue token. If the client
            needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the
            continue field. Otherwise, the client may send another list request
            with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond
            with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest
            snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results -
            objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list
            request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are
            after the "next key". This field is not supported when watch is
            true. Clients may start a watch from the last resourceVersion value
            returned by the server and not miss any modifications.
        :param field_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their fields. Defaults to everything.
        :param label_selector: A selector to restrict the list of returned objects by
            their labels. Defaults to everything.
        :param limit: limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call.
            If more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the
            list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial
            query to retrieve the next set of results. Setting a limit may
            return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items)
            in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients
            should only use the presence of the continue field to determine
            whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to
            support the limit argument and will return all of the available
            results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty,
            clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is
            not supported if watch is true. The server guarantees that the
            objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a
            single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created,
            modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be
            included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes
            referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that
            is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can
            ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during
            a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the
            time the first list result was calculated is returned.
        :param resource_version: resourceVersion sets a constraint on what resource
            versions a request may be served from. See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param resource_version_match: resourceVersionMatch determines how
            resourceVersion is applied to list calls. It is highly recommended
            that resourceVersionMatch be set for list calls where
            resourceVersion is set See
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions
            for details. Defaults to unset
        :param timeout_seconds: Timeout for the list/watch call. This limits the
            duration of the call, regardless of any activity or inactivity.
        :param watch: Watch for changes to the described resources and return them as a
            stream of add, update, and remove notifications. Specify
            resourceVersion.
        :param pretty: If 'true', then the output is pretty printed.
        :param client: optional; instance of kubernetes.client.api_client.ApiClient
        :param async_req: bool; if True, call is async and the caller must invoke
            .get() on the returned Response object. Default is False, which makes
            the call blocking.

    perNodeHostBits: PerNodeHostBits defines the number of host bits to be configured per
        node. A subnet mask determines how much of the address is used for network bits
        and host bits. For example an IPv4 address of 192.168.0.0/24, splits the address
        into 24 bits for the network portion and 8 bits for the host portion. To allocate
        256 IPs, set this field to 8 (a /24 mask for IPv4 or a /120 for IPv6). Minimum
        value is 4 (16 IPs). This field is immutable.
    ipv4: IPv4 defines an IPv4 IP block in CIDR notation(e.g. "10.0.0.0/8"). At least one
        of IPv4 and IPv6 must be specified. This field is immutable.
    ipv6: IPv6 defines an IPv6 IP block in CIDR notation(e.g. "fd12:3456:789a:1::/64"). At
        least one of IPv4 and IPv6 must be specified. This field is immutable.
    nodeSelector: NodeSelector defines which nodes the config is applicable to. An empty
        or nil NodeSelector selects all nodes. This field is immutable.
